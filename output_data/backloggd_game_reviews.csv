Title,Review
Daggerfall Unity,"Agora sim, devidamente zerado com a história principal, posso dizer: QUE JOGO INSUPORTAVEL.Ao time que criou a versão Unity: Vocês são maravilhosos e seu trabalho é incrivel.Ao time que criou o jogo original, sua história e sua gameplay: Espero que vocês tenham crescido como desenvolvedores e nunca tenham criado outra abominação como essa desgraça."
Daggerfall Unity,"i can see why people would enjoy daggerfall, but it really is not all that great gameplay wise."
Daggerfall Unity,"They made Daggerfall playable, now you can play this incredible experience without wanting to gouge your eyes out!"
Daggerfall Unity,"The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall (Unity version) improves movement, visual clarity, and the UI, but largely keeps the game intact as it was out of the box.GAMEPLAY. Where to start with this one... imagine DOOM but somehow even more terrifying. Because straight out of the gate, the starting dungeon throws bats, archers, rats, bears, imps that shoot instakill fireballs, skeletons, and more at you as you try to navigate and survive a procedurally generated hellhole labyrinth of endless claustrophobic tunnels and rooms that lead to nowhere. Imagine the goddamn jump scare I had when I'd seen no enemies for like 5 minutes and some muscle man jumps out of the wall down the hallway and nails me with an arrow. I died like twenty times in this exact same way. Sheesh. This is a straight-up horror game and you will never be more relieved to finally see the outside sunlight in any Elder Scrolls game.CHARACTER CREATION. You select your province which gives you your starting race (which for me is Black Marsh, always), and though the actual sprite that your character is represented by is pretty static with the exception of faces, the game is really surprisingly in-depth with class creation and whatnot. It gives you a generated background and even armour/weapons (based on questions you answered at the start). I chose a bard specialising in intelligence and sneak, and I got an ebony dagger, which judging by the other games and the enemies I was hitting with it, is pretty goddamn OP.THE WORLD. Not too much variety outside of dungeons. Though the map is just a tad bit bigger than the landmass of Great Britain, there will never not be a time where you don't fast travel to wherever you're going, because outside of the usual towns is endless miles of randomly generated terrain that you will never cross in its entirety no matter how long you walk. And enemies don't even spawn out in the wilderness, adding to its uselessness. Interactions with NPCs is pretty much as it is in the later Morrowind, with the exception of three tones of voice you can speak to people with. Not that it matters, because until your disposition is up, you'll get lots of ""Oh WHAT NOW"", ""You're wasting my damn time"", and ""What the hell do YOU want, Argonian?"" which is exactly how I picture people in TES universe talking to each other based on Tamriel's expansive history of warfare and slavery lol. Quests you get from NPCs are timed, even the main quest, which means if you decide to sit on your ass for weeks, the game will give you a pretty big ""fuck you"" and lock you out of the story. Games from 1996 really did not fuck around.THE VERDICT. This is a deep, surprisingly fun, if a bit flawed, pseudo-horror RPG that is basically an all around work of art, from the enemies and the sprite designs, to the scary ass sound effects of screaming skeletons and beyond. There's clearly a few things lore-wise that still needed to be ironed out, but for the most part the foundation for the future games is all here. Even the map of Tamriel has remained the exact same since 1996 and that's pretty damn amazing. Overall, it's a pretty good game that you have to try at least once in your life, especially if you're an Elder Scrolls fanatic."
Daggerfall Unity,"I played this with a bunch of audio, visual and quest mods so my experience is not very vanilla but i'll still say that i  enjoyed my time with The Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall, just moving around the Iliac Bay while enjoying the lo-fi graphics and doing some leveling is very fun, the gameplay loop is addicting and just now after finishing the main quest it makes me want to do another run with another build doing stuff in regions that i have not spent time in. The world of Daggerfall is famously massive and it truly feels like it, even if every kingdom is basically the same with the exception of the textures and the local knightly order, just traveling around and seeing interesting geometry and town layouts is surprisingly fun.But to compensate for the sheer size of Daggerfall's world Bethesda had to sacrifice something, and that was writing. Now, Bethesda was never an eminence in writing and they still aren't today, but at least they have some cool characters, set pieces and world building, with something new to see at every corner and none of those things are really here in Daggerfall, at least not in a level like what was set from Morrowind onwards. The story dungeons did not work for me, they are way too obtuse and annoying, the last dungeon being a clusterfuck of elevators, levers and random teleporters with some awful plataforming that plays about as good as you expect in a game where your character moves like they're sliding on ice skates. The absolute worse showing of this baffling level and quest design was making the player go through the Direnni tower's awful dungeon a grand total of FOUR times, very cool Bethesda. The Iliac bay itself is your typical european british medium fantasy setting on High Rock and generic sandcrete and jungle locations on Hammerfell. The few unique characters are extremely lacking in originality and they had less personality than your average Skyrim NPC, at least the prose and the few things they say are well written but that is about where my praises end for the writing.But at the end of the day and considering this was made all the way back in 96' it's pretty decent, this game would probably be more enjoyable if you play it as an infinite dungeon crawler instead of focusing on the main quest like i did but infinite radiant quests are not really my thing. Honestly, if you just ignore any letters you get and forget about the main quest you won't be missing much. Great sandbox and certainly fun gameplay (when you are not trapped in a huge dungeon) , just don't expect much (if anything) in terms of a narrative."
Daggerfall Unity,J'avais lancé le jeu pour le lore et finalement le gameplay de cette version est vraiment cool une fois passé les premières heures d'apprentissage. Je pensais pas autant aimer me perdre pendant 3h dans un donjon avant de me rendre compte que l'objectif est derrière une porte cachée dans un mur (sinon l'histoire est pas ouf avant la toute dernière quête)
Daggerfall Unity,"The epitome of an open-ended sandbox RPG. It's a shame I don't believe anything has replicated what this game has done. After you get passed this game's learning curve it can quickly become a comfort game. While this game seems hardcore, there is something so pleasant about getting lost in a dungeon every once in awhile  on a small quest. More people should try this game, genuinely."
Daggerfall Unity,"É um jogo que joguei na pandemia ali por volta de 2022 e me pegou muito. Tenho boas memórias, as dungeons e o combate me prenderam demais, estranhamente me senti muito imersivo para um game tão antigo. É claro que pra sua experiência ser boa mods gráficos deverão ser instalados. Quero voltar um dia para terminar a história !"
Daggerfall Unity,"Daggerfall has always been a remarkable title for its time, but  with the countless mods and enhancements that the community have created, it transforms into one of the greatest and most immersive gaming experiences you can have. I've never played a game that consistently surprised me more with the depth of its mechanics."
Daggerfall Unity,"Left starting dungeon, walked for a real-world hour straight, saw nothing, then saw a bear, died to the bear, back at the dungeon from an hour ago.One day I will figure out how to crack the shell and get into the fun of this game, one day."
Daggerfall Unity,"Es un juego que se le notan demasiado años que tiene y las limitaciones tecnicas para lo que queria conseguir, en cuanto al ambiente que los visuales y la musica construyen es bastante bueno igual que el lore general que sin duda es el highlight del juego, pero el sistema de progrecion tanto de los niveles y como estan conectados con el proceso de conseguir las misiones principales lo hace bastante insufrible.Planta las bases de lo que haria mucho mejor el resto de la franquicia."
Daggerfall Unity,"Completed this a few weeks before making this account, with a file I've been playing off and on for a solid 5 years or so. Something genuinely special here - it's not really the same sort of thing as a modern Bethesda game, but it's a great fantasy life simulator. I'm also the exact kind of sicko to love the ridiculously huge dungeons - I can't imagine playing this game with the ""smaller dungeons"" option given that the dungeon crawls are half the fun. It feels genuinely bottomless, too, and I expect this game to be something I keep on my hard drive forever. I played as basically a pure fighter, and I'm already looking forward to replaying as a mage or a thief, even if it does take 5 years again. I didn't even touch the Daedric quests!"
Daggerfall Unity,"Ru / EngEnglish is not a 100% correct  translation but rather how i'll wrote it onRu:Вообще вся мутень с Даггерфолом у меня началась совсем недавно, друг предложил сделать своеобразный челлендж: ""Кто дольше всех продержится (а может даже и пройдёт) Даггерфолл?"", его условия были просто игра вместе и даже насрать какая версия: по его словам обе были отменным говном. В один вечер мы сели за оригинальный и у меня мозг вытек из-за этого всего, неудобное управление (я его ещё хоть как-то настроил, к слову), дубовая боёвка где тебе надо прокликать 100500 раз своим оружием что бы дай бог попасть 2 раза во врага, в начале игры тебе всуют Импа которому к вашему оружию (завися конечно от класса) 100% неэффективен, пока друг кое как вышел из первого подземелья, я застрял на начале и был в большом недоумевании. В тот вечер у меня болела голова и шея из-за игры, решили поиграть в Юнити, друг нашёл отдельный клиент где можно поиграть вдвоём, но 2 недели точно мы не смогли собраться: то учёба, то лень, то ещё какая херь. Сегодня мы сели поиграть, друг загрузил свой сейв с города, пока я создал аж нового персонажа Мага и пройдя быстро первый данж присоединился к нему. Вот тут и появилась наша проблема с игрой, а именно просто непонимание дальнейших действий, типа понятно концепт, открытый мир, исследуй территории, выполняй квесты и так далее, но чаще всего квестов просто не было, куда бы мы не ходили то люди безработные (даже в устроенных рабочих зданиях), то не давали его вообще. Игра просто не понимает что всувать игроку после первого данжа и это печально быть честным, мне понравился данжен кроль и я готов был дальше этим заниматься. Возможно я когда нибудь это пройду, но точно не сейчас.Eng:All of the things Daggerfall was started by my friend, he started unique challenge between him and me: ""Who'll play (and maybe even beat) Daggerfall the most?"", rules were pretty much simple, he didn't cared about version whatsoever, he said they're both shit as fuck. One midnight we came together to play OG DF and my brain was just melting while playing it: stupid controls (mind i tell you, i configured everything to get somewhat decent with it), sluttering combat where you need to click at least 100500 times at enemy just to be blessed by a god himself and do 2 hits, at the beginning of the game you have a room with Imp in it, which is 100% (based on your class ofc) is not affected by you're weapon AT ALL, while my friend SOMEHOW got out from first dungeon, i was stuck in it and was in big bewilderment from all of it. I called it a day since my head and neck was hurt cause of the game, we agreed to play Unity, friend found a multiplayer mod and for at least 2 weeks we couldn't just do it by multiple reasons: school, our lazy asses, or just doesn't wanting to play it at all. Today, whoever, we finally came up together to finally do it, friend load up his previous save where he was at some town, while i created a new Mage character, blasted through first dungeon and meet up together at some spot. Here's is game's problem for us: we don't know what to do next. We understand it, like, it's an open-world, go talk with NPCs, travel around everything, do some quests, but most of NPCs we met doesn't even have them, we were genuinely stuck and called it a day, at least my friend did. I don't know for sure if i'll come back to it, i liked dungeon-crawling part of it, but doing something next is a bit of a problem now."
Daggerfall Unity,Öncelikle helal olsun sana Australia li Gavin bu modu yaptıgın için bizim gibi yeni çağ insanlarının prime dinazor dönemlerini görebilmesini ve cevherleri keşfedebilmesine imkan sağladığın için. Oyuna gelirsek kısa bi bakış attım ve sonra dönüp ciddi şekilde oynamaya karar verdim daha detaylı bir inceleme yazacağım bitirdikten sonra
Daggerfall Unity,"When you finnaly find out what you have to do to have fun, an entire country becomes you playground... (that means fast travel around the country)"
Daggerfall Unity,"It is a pretty cool game. I couldn't really get into the 90s elder scrolls games, but this version made Daggerfall so much easier to get into. It's pretty amazing how much stuff there is to see and do here. A bit dated, but a fantastic fan modernization."
Daggerfall Unity,"Confusing Dungeons, confusing class creation, confusing story (SICKASS FMV intro tho). Idk something about the atmosphere, the spooky sounds and creaking of the dungeons is so good. Plus being in towns is usually quite cosy as well. Speech is also interesting and I feel like a modern version of this could be quite good. Please bring back this spell maker, it's so crazy good and the things you can do is impressive.)"
Daggerfall Unity,"I think for a particular kind of player this game probably hits like no other in the series. I enjoy the kind of life sim elements it has and the variety of characters you can make, even if in an unmodded game a third of the skills are basically pointless. The main questline of the game on a story level is one of the most compelling and interesting in the series but its brought down I think by the way its told with it separated into two plotlines. While it might give less freedom to the player, which definitely seems to be this game's number one priority, the questline would probably be more effective if it was one long sequential line with a couple of detours for the optional quests. The dungeons are probably my least favorite thing with the game. They were pretty fun at first if overlong but as I kept playing I'd see the same dungeon pieces more and more and it kind of made it a slog to do the random quests from various guilds and the like. This affects the main quest dungeons to a lesser extent since most of those are mostly made of unique chunks but it still got to a point where I was just trying to rush through the dungeons as fast as I could to get it over with. Definitely not a bad game but it is a game for a particular kind of player."
Daggerfall Unity,Même sous la contrainte je ne parlerai pas de mes speedruns douteux
Daggerfall Unity,a wonderful port that makes an antiquated game playable in the modern era
Daggerfall Unity,"I sometimes imagine this game as a great RPG sandbox, but then when I play it the amount of artificiality just... comes crashing down.I WANT to love it, but I can only LIKE it."
Daggerfall Unity,"I didn't get to trying TES: Arena, but Daggerfall Unity's gameplay is definitely decent, it's just that there are too many annoyances and features a bit outdated. The map size and the scope of the game is interesting at first, but as even within a small town you can find repeated NPCs and houses etc the immersion is a bit limited. The size also becomes annoying for travelling within towns and figuring out where you need to go. I got a quest from a random NPC, did what they asked me, but I couldn't return them the item i got to finish the quest because I didnt know at which house he was at (i tried going one by one but it was just too much).Second dungeon I tried was bugged and I would get stuck between 3 rooms with no exit. Used a command to get out, went into another room that had to be open using a special lever, the room had a single enemy inside and nothing else, oh and you couldnt leave the room without some flying magic (which i didnt have).Will update the review once If i actually end up liking the rest of the series and giving this another shot."
Daggerfall Unity,"You have been lied to. A ""balanced build"" is a lie. ""MinMaxing"" is a lie. ""Beginner builds"" are lies. I tried them and I had no fun at all. Then, I did what I wanted and mantled Sanguine and indulged in all revelry. High Elf, pure magic and personality; hated by all classes besides the nobles. Knows all languages. Half the enemies did not attack me due to my charming altmeri smirk. The rest were obliterated by my self-replenishing fireballs. Most of the city folk hated me, but I could still sell to a few merchants. Weapons and armor were pointless, so I became the richest elf this side of the Iliac bay. I did quests only for the royalty, playing court games and rising up in high society. I bought a house in the fine kingdom of Wayrest and spilled all my exotic treasures upon the floor to admire them. I levitated above the peasantry on a horse. I carved through Mannimarco's undead army to give him a letter. I got too cocky and got lost during a mage's guild quest, missing the deadline. The price of failure was expulsion. I could no longer improve or get new spells. I stood alone in my house gazing at my pile of gold, letting bitterness overtake me. And that was it. I did not reclaim the totem. I did not meet the Blind God. I did not make-way for Mannimarco's apotheosis. I did not see the credits roll. But it was a blast. A tried and true RPG."
Daggerfall Unity,Good
Daggerfall Unity,Tenía mucha curiosidad por probar esta versión y me pareció muy bonita visualmente
Daggerfall Unity,"I loved the original game and spent months playing it, but this time it was really boring for me, I think I lost interest on this format at some point. I dropped it after a couple of hours."
Daggerfall Unity,"You have to be the right kind of person to enjoy this. Rougelike enjoyers and simulationists welcome, others beware.Upon starting ask yourself if you enjoyed the first dungeon. If so, I have great news. If not, turn away now."
Daggerfall Unity,Only playable in single sittings or you forget why everyones trying to kill you.
Daggerfall Unity,i hope ur not claustrophobic
Daggerfall Unity,"I enjoyed my time with this game, until the bug get the better of me. God the bugs.I don't know if my game is cursed or it's just that bad, but trying to complete this game is almost impossible without console command and guide.There are bugs that made the item/enemy I needed for quest not spawn, bugs that doesn't mark the quest as complete even though I did, bugs in the dungeon regarding doors and levers where it prevented me from going further into the dungeon, bugs that make quest not start at all, etc.And if all that happens on the optional quest, I would be fine. But no, it's on the main quest, I have to force restart a story quest because it refuses to be completed, I have to force start a story quest because it doesn't trigger (even when I did all the thing it needs to trigger), the final dungeon lever/password sometimes doesn't work the first time so I have to turn it off and then on again to open a few doors.BUT.... I did enjoy this game, I don't know why honestly. Maybe the simplicity of it just appeal to me, I listened to music/audiobook as I hack away and got lost in the dungeon (I will tele2qmarker after I got bored).And it made me want to check the rest of the series, even though I didn't like Skyrim back when I tried that."
Daggerfall Unity,"A great way to play the old Daggerfall. But note that Daggerfall nowadays is unironically a lackluster experience, probably only slightly less painful to play than Starfield."
Daggerfall Unity,"If you're going to play Daggerfall, by the nine divines, do it this way! It's the QoL and mods you see..."
Daggerfall Unity,"Really intriguing story that sucked me in. I loved the twist with Septim’s letter and how the story really took a turn in the latter half of the game. The gameplay is fun, but gets really samey and tedious after about 30 hours. And if you’re not a mage, Good luck. They could have made the final quest so that any class could finish the game without all the hassle, but still … an experience for sure. Probably not picking this one up again, but what can I say? Pretty good."
Daggerfall Unity,"Surprisingly this is an okay game to play if you're patient, though there's still some quirks to actually completing the main story; I would definitely keep a close eye on the UESP wiki to figure out which reputations you're supposed to raise in order to even make progress. But if you could stomach playing Morrowind for the first time nowadays and were bored and saw that Daggerfall is free on Steam, maybe give this a shot to see how it is. Don't forget to enable Player Nudity on launch, lmao.The dungeons are incredibly dense, and it's pretty crazy that they even had a fully 3d map on original release, although Unity actually lets you zoom in and change the viewing angle. It should be noted that there's a couple dungeon tiles that are absolute bullshit, like one tile where you have to push a generic wall torch to remove a plain looking wall, revealing a hidden tunnel to a few extra rooms which could contain your objective. Another tile features red brick walls that act as teleport points — these same red brick walls are featured randomly in other tiles, so you would have seen them and had no reason to actually walk into the ones that actually teleport you...This game is still super magic heavy like in Arena, especially for breaking paralysis effects put on you, as well as for the recall, water walking, and levitation spells. Also apparently Unity 'fixed' the thicc vampire chicks in this game, so now the sleep spells they lob at you from a distance actually drain your stamina instead of doing nothing. Because this spell lasts for like 45 in-game minutes, it's almost guaranteed to knock you out and one-shot you unless you have spell effects to resist or reflect that spell entirely, it's kind of dumb honestly."
Daggerfall Unity,"Normalmente eu logaria o jogo original, mas eu sou meio purista no sentido de experienciar o material original, e o Unity mesmo sendo um mod que muda mais os controles doq qualquer coisa n deixa de ser um belo de um overhaul no jogo.Simplesmente o maior jogo que eu já joguei, o conteúdo disso aqui é infindável. Infelizmente ele é praticamente todo gerado proceduralmente, oq deixa tudo muito repetitivo e monótono. Mas o jogo é carregado pela sua progressão, gameplay, sistemas e roleplay. Um jogo que jamais poderá ser replicado, elaboro mais depois."
Daggerfall Unity,"For the review of Daggerfall contents, refer to my original reviewDaggerfall Unity is the ultimate way to play Daggerfall as it allows you to use mods, console commands and it also fixes a lot of the randomization issues that will get you softlocked."
Daggerfall Unity,more of a medieval rags to riches simulator than the curated experience of later Elder Scrolls games. It's not too painful considering you can always just exploit your way to whatever power level or financial status you think is appropriate for your character.
Daggerfall Unity,"This game is objectively a 3 star but in my heart it is a 4 star game, so I'm splitting the difference here.Character customization is so in-depth, and it is easy to make the player my own. Despite all locations existing kind of separate from each other, the world does feel grand, and its main characters feel alive."
Daggerfall Unity,"I really like the character creation, combat and the general loop of go to a place > get a random quest that takes you to another place > get a new random quest. However, I am getting worn out by how difficult it is to tell where you're supposed to be going and it's hard to get info from people because everyone is rude to me?Also, this has made it clear to me what major improvements they made with Morrowind, so I am thinking I can now go into that game with an appreciation for the cool stuff it added without having as much baggage about it being way more obtuse than Oblivion. Playing Daggerfall, I found myself thinking ""Man, I wish this world was a bit visually weirder and I was able to get more info about the world from the NPCs. Wait, what if you could click on a word to learn more about it?!"""
Daggerfall Unity,"I was having Bethesda brain worms and I was getting pretty desperate to try one of them I haven't played yet, so I tried Daggerfall. Its pretty cool, and I enjoy the sprite characters and 3D enviroments, the combat was something I wanted to do more of. The thing that kind of made me stop was just that I need some drive to do stuff. Its very cool that this game is basically a life simulator and you can just whatever the fuck you want, but I need more incentive. I also found it kind of hard to just go to a dungeon and do it compared to modern Bethesda games. LIke yeah, I can just go to a dungeon, but the map is huge and I didnt find one super quick so it irked me."
Daggerfall Unity,This is a labor of love in every sense of the phrase. The creator of this project is highly involved in the community and has left it open so that modding is widely available for fans to experience. I've been following the project for years and it never ceases to fascinate me!
Daggerfall Unity,"now this is more like it, this is daggerfall like bethesda probably wanted it to be. movement, combat, etc are all fixed, and suddenly it's actually fun. i still have no idea what im doing, but at least the journey to figure it out is actually fun now. this game truly makes you feel like some nobody who just wandered out of a cave, you gotta work for everything, as opposed to later games where you become grand wizard of the mage guild or whatever 3 hours in (i still love you though, skyrim). if youve ever wanted todd howard to personally come in your house and stomp on your balls, he didnt make this one but it's the closest youre ever gonna get."
Daggerfall Unity,Obtuse!
Luanti,"Minecraft but if it it didn't have the stupid hunger bar, fun"
Luanti,Well-made open-source Minecraft clone. Sadly missing the rich community and culture that makes Minecraft a masterpiece.
Luanti,"E' stato un bel tuffo nel passato...grazie mille Minetest, PegheLeg e C-140 <3Troppi bug comunque, infatti ora inizierà finalmente il vero gameplay su Minecraft a distanza di 8 anni dalla mia ultima giocata sulla creatura di ""Notch brutta merda servo"".Pagella videoludicaGameplay: 6Grafica: 5Rigiocabilità: nessunaVoto complessivo: 6-"
Luanti,"With mods, this easily becomes the single best alternative to playing MC. Minetest is technically not a game, but a voxel engine which serves as a platform to make games. It's very simple to download fan projects right from the main menu and start playing them. The community is active and often creative - besides the expected imitations of MC survival mode (VoxeLibre, Mineclonia), there are linear games with stories or challenging puzzles. I expect the library of content will only continue to grow."
Luanti,Good if you're poor.
Luanti,"Joguei o MineClonia e um pouco do Minetest Game. É bom para quem gosta de Minecraft mas quer se manter nos princípios do FOSS, não quer gastar dinheiro ou não tem uma máquina potente, embora seja muito limitado comparado com o original e para mim realmente é um problema o jeito que a física funciona e a ausência de correr."
Luanti,I prefer this to minecraft
Luanti,Super glow glass block
Luanti,"As much as I want this game to succeed, it's doing something wrong, and I don't know what that is..."
Luanti,"I used to play this game a lot in 2011 and 2012, before I had Minecraft.  When it comes to a Minecraft clone, this game is probably still the closest to the original when you compare it to other Minecraft clones.I used to play with version 3.x and there was already not super much possible. I could build a base, there were old ruins with monsters (2D sprites), some tools and that was it. Nevertheless, I had fun with it for a few weeks back than.Now I've had a look at the latest version (5.5.1) and apparently I should have kept the game in quite good memory. The game looks better than before, and the crafting system and items are closer to the original. Unfortunately, the world feels very empty and lifeless. You are completely alone. At least I didn't find any animals or other NPCs in the estimated 7 hours I played at the weekend. On the positive side, I would like to mention that there seems to be a large and active mod community.In a direct comparison, I would spend 10€ for Minecraft again. Or how much does it cost these days?"
OpenRA,"Great game to play with friends, even the ones who are not RTS pros. I recommend trying Combined Arms mod"
OpenRA,Açık Kaynak şeklinde geliştirilmiş Red Alert alternatifi. Neredeyse 20 yıllık olmasına karşın hala güncelleme gelmeye devam ediyor. Arkadaşlar ile epey zevkli bir oynanışı var. Bedava olmasından ve kolay öğrenilmesinden kaynaklı önerilir.
SuperTux,hell yeah
SuperTux,"Another childhood game growing in the 2000s meant we were the first, at least here in Portugal, to be provided laptops by the school, and these laptops where specifically designed for children of elementary grade they even had a handle and padding look it up ""Magalhaes laptop"" it is very cute if you are from Venezuela or Bolívia there's a chance you had one of these as well, and if it looks familiar to Brasilian people it is also based on the Classmate PC version 2 :)👍anyways it ran both Windows XP and a Linux distro based on Debian called ""Caixa Mágica"" which means magic box the thing is no teacher knew how to use linux in elementary school at least where I lived so no one actually used it except for... this supertux an unfinished but not lacking in content 2d platformer that very much plays like a Mario game to a legal infringement level but as kids we didn't care and it was a fairly fun if a bit overly challenging game at times not because the game it self is very hard but because some of the checkpoint locations are a bit hmmm 𝓪𝓼𝓼𝓱𝓸𝓵𝓲𝓪𝓷. As an adult though, this took maybe 3 hours to finish, still there were some challenging bits but nothing crazy except for that one level where the checkpoint does not save you getting the spring item, so you have to do 2 really hard segments in a row without dying, and I died a lot...Also for any other nostalgic boy or girl or else hmmm its on Steam, like it's just there just don't tell Nintendo."
SuperTux,Mi primerito juego de plataformas
SuperTux,"Classic ever since Linux, now on Windows"
SuperTux,Lenda do Magalhães.
SuperTux,Miss this shit
SuperTux,jeu fantastique copié par mario bros il faut le savoir
SuperTux,We've got Mario at home! But instead it turns out that it's actually quite fun.
SuperTux,ah este juego que te venia en la netbook del gorbierno por alguna razon.....
SuperTux,this was my roman empire when i was 9
SuperTux,"what you're referring to as supertux is in fact gnu/supertux, or as I've taken to calling it, gnu + supertuxI've followed development on this game since 0.3.X, playing most major releases since. progress has been glacial (pardon the pun) for sure, but the game is still perfectly playable as of right now. there's a few things I miss from 0.1.X such as the old sound effects, but I understand they wish to keep a consistent and specific style.the game plays very well, tux controls exactly as you expect him to and all of the official levels feel fair enough to complete. unfortunately the game itself doesn't do all too much to stand out from other 2D platformers other than ""oh it's the linux platformer"", but it at least does what it wants to do very well. the game also allows you to play and create custom levels, so there's a lot more content waiting if the main game felt too short.I still miss the ""Excellent!"" soundbyte though please bring it back for 0.7"
SuperTux,peak fiction
SuperTux,my COLD take on this game is that it FREEZES your cognition of time in a BREEZE specially when you're trying to ICE the game ba tum tass
SuperTux,oh my god i found it
SuperTux,"Uma imitação do Mário. Mas, acho que é tão bom quanto!"
SuperTux,"Unironically better than some Mario games. I feel some kind of connection to this game, seeing as back in the days it was one of the only worthwhile games that worked on a Linux machine"
SuperTux,"It's a fun experience, but having so many other games to play I can't  bring myself to keep playing it until completion."
SuperTux,this was fr a video game
SuperTux,"Can't really give any pros or cons about this one, just an all-around great first 2D platformer for a 5-year old Francca. Had this on a tiny Linux laptop when I was young, it even had a level editor and everything! I would've given a better rating but from what I remember the game was pretty derivative of 2D Marios at the time, so I can't give too much credit"
SuperTux,better than new super mario bros for the ds
SuperTux,"I played this all the way through, all the way completed, multiple times, on both Windows and Mac. I THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. This is a really fun platformer with really well drawn designs. I love the artstyle, music, and gameplay of this game. I don't care that it isn't finished, I love it! It is 100% free on any computer known to man, for the lova- YOU CAN PLAY IT ON THE STEAM DECK."
SuperTux,"jogar isto no magalhães, muito bom"
SuperTux,Microsoft are done for
SuperTux,JUEGAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Battle for Wesnoth,"One of the best fantasy-themed turn-based strategy games of its ilk (its ilk being too granular to be a 4X strategy game, yet not fine-grained enough to be a tactical RPG). And certainly one of the best open-source games I've played. There is a lot of content built-in, but the real meat and potatoes is in the the amount of high-quality user-created campaigns with all sorts of custom art, units and so on that you can download from within the game. The only thing I can knock this game down for is its difficulty. Which can get brutal even for the base campaigns, and incentivizes save-scumming."
Battle for Wesnoth,"Freeware banger, and honestly still worth your time, if a little slow with more than 2-3 players."
Battle for Wesnoth,joguei quando tinha um pc horroroso e sigo jogando com um pc bom
Battle for Wesnoth,"La nostalgie parle mais c""est un bon jeu de stratégie dans un monde médiéval-fantastique qui nous donne des bons scénario. Plus la difficulté peu vraiment surprendre sur certains d'entre eux."
Battle for Wesnoth,"Um dos meus primeiros contatos com jogos mais táticos, muito divertido, mas com uma curva de aprendizado difícil de pegar, mas que vale muito a pena investir um tempo e aprender."
Battle for Wesnoth,"I played too much of this game growing up - first time I learned about fog of war. Surprisingly meaty, free is kinda crazy, with tons of different factions and campaigns. It's the editor tools that put this over the top (my sibling made a sweet pirate-themed campaign that I loved)."
Battle for Wesnoth,I really like this game. It makes my brain big. Steam won't let me update or reinstall it. Big sad.
Battle for Wesnoth,Honestly played waaaaay too much of this game. Modded campaign with friends is fun. 230+ hours.
Battle for Wesnoth,"I dont know how many hours I really poured into this game since i only played it for a few minutes on steam, but i have some REAL great memories playing it with my family in my childhood. It was one of the ggames that introduced me to gaming, and I'll always be fond of it"
Battle for Wesnoth,Si seulement tous mes amis ne détestaient pas le jeu… (je suis le problème)
Battle for Wesnoth,so many long nights playing survival extreme
Battle for Wesnoth,Fantastic and surprisingly deep tactics game with great campaigns and cool user content. And it's free!
Battle for Wesnoth,"Really fun, and the moddability is insane, first game I script modded for."
Battle for Wesnoth,"they made a weapon to induce confirmation bias in people directly, and i am absolutely in awe of its power"
Battle for Wesnoth,"Some of my best story-experiences ever have been User Made Content (UMC) campaigns of Wesnoth! I mean, I love Lord of the Rings, but I enjoyed the Dragon Trilogy UMC campaign just as much, if not more! However, the campaigns, including the mainline campaigns, vary in quality a lot.Unfortunately, some great and/or fun campaigns are not available for the newer versions (though you can still play the old versions I suppose)I've also spent tons of time playing this online. It was fun, if you had the patience, but these days it seems impossible to find 4 players for a single 2vs2  match (even if you bring one friend).Give it a try, it's free and Open Source"
Battle for Wesnoth,"Considering the fact that it's a completely free, well-made tactical game with a plethora of content and easily accessible add-ons, I can't not give it 5 stars. This has been one of my most played games for many years, and I expect that I'll continue to play it for a long time. It's interesting though, I've never really been that interested in fire emblem, or any other tactics game for that matter, but something about this one just clicks with me. The music and artwork, the simple yet effective character design, and the setting are all interesting. Are there elements that I think could be improved? Of course, the RNG element can be very frustrating at times, but it still rewards good strategy and planning in advance."
Battle for Wesnoth,The difficulty can be pushed way up on this game. Love that about it. Figuring out how to beat the campaigns at max difficulty was fun. The gameplay does tend to get a bit dull after a certain point.
Battle for Wesnoth,+ Free old-school tactical RPG with plenty of depth and variety. Includes more campaigns than the vast majority of retail games± The battles tend to be long and somewhat difficult- Expect to lose units due to the high degree of randomness from dice rolls. Save often; you'll probably need to reload at some point- Having to level up healers by attacking gets tedious
Battle for Wesnoth,"One of the best tactic games out there with a great modding community.I don't have many friends who like this genre, but I'm sure that this would be a blast with some of those."
Battle for Wesnoth,"The only thing stopping this game from being a 10/10 is the horrible system to play online, you need to register in their 2005 forum that looks and works like 2005 forums and wait for them to accept you, only then you can login and play online. But this is a game from 2005, and by 2005 standards this is a 2005/10."
Battle for Wesnoth,ResidentSleeper
Battle for Wesnoth,What people don't get is that you plan ahead of the RNG and keep plenty of cannon fodder. Very high quality free game.
Battle for Wesnoth,this is the lord of the rings game you've been looking for
Battle for Wesnoth,Played this a ton as a kid
Battle for Wesnoth,Linux wins again
Battle for Wesnoth,"Still go back to it from time to time, to scream at my PC because of bad RNG"
Battle for Wesnoth,"Played it when I was a kid, had no Idea what I was doing, but I liked doing it👍"
Battle for Wesnoth,"You don't play this one because it's a hidden gem or anything, you play it because it's good enough and free."
Battle for Wesnoth,"I barely remembered this when I saw it on steam, but it was shared with me by my Dad so I gave it a shot. Its fine. I'll go spend six hours playing super tux again now bye."
Battle for Wesnoth,Mi infacia ;-;
Mindustry,"Es un juegazardo, lástima que es un vórtice de tiempo absoluto, querés jugar una horita y terminás jugando 8, arruinandote tu siguiente día porque te vas a dormir a las 10 de la mañana."
Mindustry,"i love this game, but i hate at the same time, but i love"
Mindustry,"it's pretty good, unfortunately i am really bad at it"
Mindustry,voce é a propria revolução industrial
Mindustry,might be 4.5 i need to play it again and more. its a better factorio imo
Mindustry,Amazing planetary takeover RTS/Tower defense/Factory builder that is opensource with a plethora of mods.
Mindustry,"It’s a pretty good game. It’s pretty unique, and it has a lot of interesting mechanics. I just think that the level design is awful. Having to restart your factory 50 times makes me not want to make anything interesting, and just rush whatever the minimum amount of defense would be. Also every level encourages rushing as fast as possible for the first 10 minutes, and then it’s boring until the last couple of waves, while you just add minor improvements to your defense. Finally, losing makes the level a lot easier by saving your factory for next playthrough, which makes it extremely easy to beat any level with brute force and not intelligent design. It’s not for me."
Mindustry,"one of the best TRULY free games out there. like no microtransactions. really fun coop game, good for OCD engineers such as myself"
Mindustry,No es lo mío.
Mindustry,sou muito 🤓 quando se trata de jogos de manejamento de recursos e posso dizer com certeza que esse é o melhor que eu já joguei
Mindustry,"This game is like crack if you want tower defense with an entire planet to worry about defending. It starts off deceptively simple, and then as time goes on it starts getting evil.I think the most fun from this game comes with friends because the workload of routing resources gets split, and the fun of melting through hordes of robots starts turning into exasperation; when the walls fail and suddenly the Fuck-Shit-Stack your buddy built isn't cutting it, you rip it up, throw in new developments he missed and the Fuck-Shit-Stack 2.0 is born.The game isn't anywhere near something like Factorio or Satisfactory on complexity in terms of production chains, though the nightmare-spaghetti of conveyer belts is very much still there and made more dire by the focus of resources more or less all feeding into combat rather than anything else. You do make more advanced materials from other materials, sure, but in the end those higher tiers are ultimately going right back into firepower of some variety, whether it's turrets or drone swarms you can command.I think the only thing I take off for Mindustry is just that I do wish it had something a little more, and that once you lose your stride it starts becoming increasingly tedious to catch back up and reclaim sectors/regions when you're already getting your teeth kicked in."
Mindustry,"Very addictive tower defense mode, more than real time strategy. The graphics are simple, there is some lore. It is more fun to play with friends, but also alone you can spend a fascinating time, if you like automation."
Mindustry,i want to kill every person i have played this game with
Mindustry,Just didn't compel me as much as I'd hoped. Offers nothing that I couldn't get better from other games in its style.
Mindustry,"Good logistics game, but I don't like the rts elements and the logistics aren't good enough to carry."
Mindustry,"Like factorio but less deep, great with friends tho"
Mindustry,factory game with simplistic graphics that make it all the more charmingtoxopid my beloved
Mindustry,factorio but 2d
Mindustry,"super fun, similar to factorio or so ive been told"
Mindustry,80/100
Mindustry,"Such a good game, also great mod system and good frequent updates."
Mindustry,It's whatever. My engineering friends seem to like it.
Mindustry,"Unlike some others in its genre, this one is prone to getting stale fast"
Mindustry,"My partner forced me to play this with him and I am happy he did!Overall a really good RTS game, you don't really have to be the absolute best to win, but do try to plan well.Weirdly specific, it strongly reminds me of playing Lego Battles when I was younger and evokes a nostalgic feeling no other RTS has."
Mindustry,fazendinha de automação não muito legal
Mindustry,"Such an obvious combination of genres, and yet no game has done it like Mindustry before or since. I remember the first time I played this game through on version 5.0, I was absolutely engrossed in it. My one gripe with this game is that it's changed a lot since then; some have really distanced it from what it used to be, but it's been in service of creating something that's possibly even better."
Mindustry,Router
Mindustry,guys its silly
Mindustry,блять где графит
Mindustry,"Is this just a Factorio clone? Yes, in the same way, that every shooter after the release of Doom was a Doom clone.Mindustry is a combination between an automation game and a tower defense. Instead of having a big open world, you are limited to a small area and its resources. Those materials have to be turned into the most efficient defense possible, otherwise you risk being overrun.As can be gleaned from the artstyle it is more simplistic than its rivals. However, that is only on the surface, there is still plenty of depth if you are willing to look for it.If what I described seems interesting, then give it a go. There is also multiplayer if you have friends. Unfortunately for fans of Factorio and others, they probably won’t find much enjoyment here, simply because it differs from the norm in many aspects.𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲There is no story. The enemies are coming, and you have to destroy them before they destroy you. War without reason.𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲There are 3 main game modes – the campaign, multiplayer, and the editor. I will focus mostly on the multiplayer since that’s what I am most familiar with.The main gameplay loop is simple. You and your core drop into a sector. At intervals of a few minutes, enemies will attack in an attempt to destroy the core. Your goal is to create the best defense possible, that can withstand their assault. After that, you launch the core and the resources it accumulated. At this stage, you get a view of a planet and can choose where to drop next. That’s where you also access the tech tree, from which you unlock new buildings and tech.It's a very effective gameplay loop, mainly due to the well-designed progression system. After every drop, you unlock something new that will probably be useful in the future. However, as you become more powerful, so do your enemies. New types will be introduced, like flying ones, that bypass walls and are unhittable by most turrets. Not every map has the same materials and equivalent quantities. Thus, you will be required to often change tactics, like using different turrets or ammunition. Firepower alone won’t be enough; you also need to learn how to optimize your factory and get the most out of it in the limited space you are given. For some of the more extreme sectors, this is a must, as without the optimal defenses, defeat is inevitable.There is plenty of content to keep anyone occupied for at least 10 to 20 hours. Not to mention an entire other planet where all the basics like mining and transport change completely.Overall, what I am trying to imply is that Mindustry is similar to its competitors in only one aspect. The addition of tower defense and the constantly changing environment, turns what could be described as a Factorio clone into a fun and unique experience that I haven't seen anywhere else.𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐬/𝐀𝐫𝐭𝐬𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞It is a game made mostly by one person, so realistic graphics are off the table. What I can say about the artstyle used is that it's nice to look at and conveys the information it has to. There is little to no unnecessary detail.𝐀𝐭𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞/𝐈𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧I can’t say that it has any atmosphere.𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤Maybe it's because I’ve heard it so many times, but this soundtrack is very memorable. It's mostly synthwave (I think), utilizing piano and some other instruments that I don’t recognize. I don’t know the exact genre, but I’ve heard it described as the type of music you hear when the villain’s army of robots starts rolling out, which is a fitting description.My favourite track is “Day5”.𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬Pro tip: don’t bother with conveyors, just use routers."
Mindustry,"Fun with friends, but a bit overwhelming and so many things look alike that it can be confusing to find the right factories / towers / buildings. Also it just makes me want to play Factorio most of the time."
Mindustry,Fun for the first couple hours but it gets boring REAL fast.
Mindustry,Vicio
Mindustry,"It's fun, but gets old rather quickly. The multiplayer aspect is easily one of Mindustry's biggest strengths. (Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to try out Factorio.)"
Mindustry,"Its a nice tower defense game but I prefer the old progress system, this planet thing is kinda confusing and over complicated"
Mindustry,factorio for the autistics that aren't smart enough for factorio
Mindustry,Great tower defence game with resource management mechanics. Makes you feel smarter than you actually are.
Mindustry,"It's fun but sometimes skirmishes against other players take an eternity where both players are basically deadlocked on resources and units and can't really beat each other, at that point it becomes a battle of patience, it's kinda like an hardcore RTS at that point where if both players are playing correctly finishing a match can take literal hours unless someone messes up."
Mindustry,"Factorio, but with something to kill, and more annoying/limited item transport options. Wonderful mod support."
Mindustry,Peak industrialization game
Mindustry,I don't think this game could make me like it. I prefer Factorio over this. It really did not live up to my expectations. A very shallow game.
Mindustry,"Only 20 mins play time, so I won't rate it. It's a basic Factorio with tower defence elements. I just didn't like the look, or the interactivity. I imagine in later 'levels' resources will be scarce so defences have to be picked wisely, but I just wasn't bothered."
Mindustry,factorio did it better
Mindustry,"Los niveles están bien locos, es como el Factorio pero para un ratito, debería jugarlo más."
Mindustry,"Nettes Automationsspiel, aber es gibt einige Designentscheidungen, die ich nicht so ganz nachvollziehen kann. Wenn ein Level geschafft ist, muss man sich noch ein paar Minuten anschauen, wie die nötigen Ressourcen fürs nächste Level gesammelt werden..warum? Grundsätzlich muss man auch mit perfektem Ressourcenabbau oft lange auf Ressourcen warten. Es gibt teilweise nichts mehr zu verbessern oder zu optimieren und dann heißt es warten, bis endlich genug Panzer ausgeworfen wurden."
Mindustry,"At the time of writing, two worlds are available, each with their own campaign. I played through most of Erekir before deciding I'd had enough and switching to Serpulo. I was surprised by just how different it was, but I was too burnt out on the game at that point to care. I only ended up playing the first two levels before dropping the game for good, so this is a review of Erekir only.For starters, this game has to be commended for providing a satisfactory (hehe) factory building experience on mobile. The UI works well and all of the factory elements are there. It's never going to get as complex as its PC counterparts, but I was shocked it was as deep as it was. There are some hiccups when trying to tie anything together, but nothing some small corrections couldn't fix. This was the main thing a mobile game like this needed to get right, and thankfully it did!What sets this apart base-building wise from other games is how compact everything has to be. You're often placed into narrow landscapes and you have to somehow cram everything into tight spaces while taking into account where resources are. It's a micro challenge of its own and often I had knots of conveyors that were completely undecipherable yet working as planned. This would be an issue for expanding said base, but the game is split into levels so you'll never stick to one area for too long, meaning these temporary disasters of design are suitable.Where the game kinda falls apart is its objectives. This is both a factory building game and a tower defence. I was worried at first that trying to construct defences on a small screen while under attack would be frustrating, but thankfully this was a non-issue with the ability to pause the action while you place things down, unpausing to let everything be created. The problem lies in just how boring the action is. There's a very thin line between completely obliterating your enemy with immovable defences and an unstoppable battalion of tanks, mechs and ships, as opposed to getting wiped out by an unseen threat that suddenly drops the strongest units in the game onto your base's one weak point. There's no push and pull that makes tower defence exciting; at the end of each level, I've either spent hours toiling away at a strategy that takes zero skill to finally execute (huge anticlimax), or I've spent hours just to be crushed by enemy forces because I had no idea what kind of units they'd have or where they'd attack from. Losing this progress was the biggest demotivator and lead to me finally giving up the game.I like Mindustry, as a platform for factory creation it's really solid and pretty outstanding for a mobile offering. I just think a game like this could be better (or, I suppose, cater more to my tastes) with less combat-oriented level design or just a more open experience like Factorio and its counterparts. Still, strong showing and I might jump back in when/if a new planet is released."
Mindustry,"solido juego de recursos como factorio con toques de tower defense, no mentire me parecio muy entretenido y tiene multijufador"
Mindustry,Poor man's factorio
Mindustry,"The kind of game that leaves me slackjawed staring at a screen for hours, completely unaware of anything going on around me. Making wee conveyor belt monstrosities. I imagine I'll end up with about 7,000,000 hours in this eventually."
Mindustry,"When you're bored it's good, otherwise, there are better options."
Mindustry,A very satisfying and fun resource-management-tower-defense game. Great CO-OP integration!
Mindustry,"Really fun, made a friend get into it a looong time ago. It's made lots of progress over the years.Funny thing is, I sort of knew the dev and have him added in all sorts of places. Old Cave Story Forums does that to people. I have issues with comparing myself to other people, but this game is actually good so I'm okay with it being sizable.The mining, building and tower defense elements combined are really fun, but it can end up being just as tense so I can only play this game in short bursts."
Mindustry,i can build a optimized silicon smelter from memory and im not proud of this
Mindustry,Just play Factorio instead
Mindustry,Great game with great gameplay. The dev for this game also works extremely hard to make the game better and improve on the game continuously. Amazing experience.
Mindustry,"A little like Factorio with a far heavier emphasis on tower defense. I really like it, though sometimes getting efficient factories set up with the space constraints can be frustrating."
Mindustry,"tower defense/resource management game similar to Factorio (so I have heard) introduced me to a genre of games I began to love, engineering games"
Mindustry,"A very well executed genre blend of tower defense, resource management, and real time strategy. Multiplayer modes combined with custom workshop maps lead to endless amounts of fun."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"been playing on and off for years now, probably on my top ten most played games ever, also probably my favorite roguelike"
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"When smartphone were only powerful enough to run fruit ninja and jetpack joyride, this game brought me into the real rogelike experience. Came back to it recently and it's still very good yet still so hard, difficulty is kinda unbalanced at some point but maybe i just suck."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"Good open-source mobile game, it gets too hard later in the dungeon though"
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,Frustrating but neat.
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"Builds meaningfully on original PD, though I somewhat prefer the simplicity of the original."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"The Mobile game of all time. Truly free, can sink you for HOURS, is nice to play even on a ride or when you can only hop in for a few mins. Classic roguelike that absolutely robbed me of my time."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"I cannot beat this goddamn game. Oh my god. You die so easily to such nothing moments. Of course, that's kind of the point"
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"A well-designed traditional roguelike with enough modern touches to make it accessible to non-grognards. I particularly enjoyed the class selection, as each option offers unique mechanics that genuinely change up the core gameplay loop. Ultimately I had to uninstall the app because I have an addictive personality and having it on my phone was ruining my life."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"A well-designed traditional roguelike with enough modern touches to make it accessible to non-grognards. I particularly enjoyed the class selection, as each class has unique mechanics that give them a truly different playstyle from the others. Ultimately I had to uninstall this game because I have an addictive personality and having it on my phone was ruining my life."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,Just...so unbelieavably amazing (even tho I've literally never beat it).No ads. Every single level is unique. There's so much to do within the game. Just the perfect mobile game and the perfect game. You can really feel the passion the devs have for it.
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"Buen juego.Literalmente como el otro de los mismos creadores, pero mejor. Este tampoco me lo pase, pero si que se disfruto mas."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"Joya oculta de la play store, roguelike de los chulos."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"Maybe the best free mobile game ever? Challenging, really deep, tons to do. Absolutely no microtransactions or ads pushed on you at all. Been getting updates for a decade. It's peak. I've never won a run and don't think I ever will but I come back to it regularly for another try."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"This was my first roguelike and honestly, it's one of the best. There's such a comfortable sense of adventure and whimsy to it. I love giving it a run and seeing what'll happen, and even the failures don't sting that much."
Shattered Pixel Dungeon,"The original Pixel Dungeon took a lot of inspiration from Brogue and it was a wonderful game, Shattered took PD and made it even better. It's a mastahpiece."
TripleA,"Great for when you want to play A&A online or solo. Has all the depth of the tabletop and then some. My only real constructive feedback would be to make the AI better for solo games, as it's quite easy even on the hardest difficutlty"
OpenTTD,Poor mans Transport fever... but technically came before... idk how I even got this game...
OpenTTD,I don't play nerd games.
OpenTTD,"We do business here, and we build trains here. with trains ."
OpenTTD,Masterpiece
OpenTTD,"It was the only game that me and my dad hade the same intrest in, gives me a lot of nostalgia from playing whit my dad. keep picking it upp hear and there and there to play it"
OpenTTD,"O OpenTTD é um bom remake do Transport Tycoon de 2004, e o interessante é q ele continua a receber atualizações até os dias de hoje.Os gráficos do jogo funcionam mto bem hj em dia, pq apesar de datados, eles são um estilo q envelheceu bem, já não da pra dizer o mesmo dos menus, q tem bem a cara de softwares antigos, são feinhos, mas funcionam.Nesse jogo de gerenciamento, o objetivo é gerenciar uma empresa privada de transportes, criando renda com ônibus, trens, navios e aviões, e fazendo com q esses meios de transporte impactem a sociedade, vendo a cidade crescer por conta desses avanços, e sendo a líder de mercado no ramo. Para isso dá pra conectar usinas/metalúrgicas/fazendas com as suas matérias-primas, fornecer transporte para a população, definir horários, paradas, rotas, construir estradas, melhorar os meios de transporte e etc, são atividades complexas e completas, e apesar de não ter um tutorial no jogo, tem um tutorial bem completo no site.O grande problema é o jogo não ter uma gameplay elaborada no late game, já q depois de criar uma base desenvolvida, é só acelerar o jogo e vislumbrar a cidade crescer com um monte de dinheiro subindo na tela, oq é bem divertido.Esse é um jogo q evoluiu mto bem, e mantém sua qualidade, não é a toa q vem recebendo atualizações até hj pela comunidade.Nota: 7/10 (★★★☆) - Bom"
OpenTTD,"I'm still convinced that OpenTTD multiplayer is secretly a dystopian strategy game, where megacorporations wage war and sabotage eachother over profits and cities"
OpenTTD,I absolutely adore the aesthetics of this game but I lack the patience to learn how to play it properly.
OpenTTD,i love my gay little trains
OpenTTD,"Bit dated, but there's a good game there still and lots of fun with friends."
OpenTTD,"I played this a while ago, for a long time, off of Steam, and I enjoyed it. Another cool sandbox that runs way deeper than I could ever get into it."
OpenTTD,4 stars in the first few hours but there's not much to do in the late game
OpenTTD,caffeine for autistic people
OpenTTD,"A great trip down memory lane. But perhaps we were just worse at games at the time, or perhaps part of the challenge was playing this on cramped screens, but today it just feels way too easy. There's no real challenge here, just a fun nostalgic train set. It's fun for a few hours and certainly pushes all the right buttons to remember, but it's no more than a toy to be discarded after a few hours of play."
OpenTTD,might be the most beautiful game of all time
OpenTTD,TTD is a great logistics game. Easy to spend hours building train routes and making all of the money.
OpenTTD,Holds up suprising well and stands out in the city builder? genre
OpenTTD,Most fun you can have for the pricetag of zilch.
OpenTTD,"A mainstay in my library, I play this game in my sleep. Endlessly replayable, and the learning curve isn't as sharp as it seems - did I mention free? If you've ever had a thought about a train beyond where it was taking you, just give it a try."
OpenTTD,jag hatar tåg
OpenTTD,"Unbelievably addictive, I end up being unable to go to sleep because my mind keeps thinking of train signals and bridges.Only bad thing is planes are too overpowered. If you want to really play I would not use planes at all and make sure your friends don't too."
OpenTTD,Trains
OpenTTD,esta perro matarle los conductores a miyabi
OpenTTD,"It's pretty cool, but it's not my type of game."
OpenTTD,"Joguinho muito bom, trilhos de trem são complicados."
OpenTTD,"Juego del año del orto que es esencialmente el tatarabuelo de los Transport Tycoon. El juego tiene una cantidad sorprendente de profundidad, tipo todo lo que es el sistema de producción de mercancía para poder vender en ciudades para la mayor cantidad de plata, la obtención de mejores vehículos dependiendo del pasaje del tiempo in-game con tecnologías basadas en la época, o el poder hacer plata custom con ratios de cambio también custom (viva hacer una economía basada en el intercambio de sapos).El juego es divertido y le metí una buena cantidad de tiempo (27h), así que la única queja sería la puta música que el juego te taladra en la cabeza."
OpenTTD,Fazer trenzinho bom demais.
OpenTTD,"Pô esse game fez minha infância, me salvou quando eu só tinha um celular e um PC ruim pra jogar."
OpenTTD,"This remake of Transport Tycoon Deluxe can feel very overwhelming at first, but if you do your homework, it can be satisfying to see your trains, buses, planes, and other vehicles transport various shipments. However, the game can feel like it lacks a real objective and is almost too open, which leads to me getting bored pretty quickly. Feeling like I had to fight the UI and some basic mechanics didn’t help either."
OpenTTD,goddammit this game tricked me into liking logistics
OpenTTD,transatlantic slave trade inc
OpenTTD,The Original Transport Tycoon 1994 was my first PC game ever and OpenTTD just made it bigger and better since then. This will forever be my favorite game.
OpenTTD,"The best transport game I've ever played, one of the top of all time. Amazing community and hundreds of mods. All that while being free and open source."
OpenTTD,"I love these old tycoon games because their interface and mechanics are completely unintuitive to me, but the satisfaction I get from setting up my first little bus station is immense"
OpenTTD,Trains make me 😩
OpenTTD,Injecting a duster into my brain and tickling my logistics center. OpenTTD is a game that will never quite simulate an economy like a certain other game but will make me think about train schedules more than I have to think about relative particles.
OpenTTD,transporting without the drugs
OpenTTD,i like trains
OpenTTD,Will play again
OpenTTD,I kinda just like watching it do its thing
OpenTTD,"relaxante demais, seh loko :)"
OpenTTD,The father of transportation network games. Aged extremely well!
OpenTTD,"easily the best transit tycoon of all time, not to mention it's freeonly complaint is that it's not as dynamic or challenging as I'd like it to be but the game is so modable that that might be fixable for you (or me!)"
OpenTTD,It's just like an adults version of Rollercoaster Tycoon
OpenTTD,"A triumph of open source software 30 years after Transport Tycoon and 20 years after first release, OpenTTD continues to prove that gameplay beats graphics any day."
OpenTTD,best strategic tycoon game
OpenTTD,I like trains
OpenTTD,Best tycoon game ever seen.
OpenTTD,Love this game
OpenTTD,Its too complicated for my small brain
OpenTTD,yep
OpenTTD,"Want to prove you can run public transport better than those hacks at Arriva? Then give this game an install. It's free, can run on a potato and is very addictive."
OpenTTD,"A game from the childhood now re-opened, thanks."
OpenTTD,"Despite being a small game that doesn't take up a lot of space, this game offers a lot of fun especially for those that like building businesses (especially ones about transportation). I had lots of fun learning about designing railway systems and growing my transportation empire to a huge size. There's also something about watching the machines go that is really satisfying. However, this game can also be as fun as it is frustrating as trying to optimize your systems can lead to a lot of complications. While the game offers four types of transportation, trains are where you'll spend the most focus on as they're the ones that require the most setup, needing stations and railing to connect them together. Where there's a lot of fun and potential in this system, it can also lead to complications (such as head-on collisions and traffic).Overall this game is a really fun and enjoyable experience and I would definitely suggest giving this a go (it's free)"
OpenTTD,"the greatest sim of all time, available for free, on like every platform ever. go play this now.the base game itself isn't super in depth or really something you can play for hundreds of hours, but with awesome mod support, it becomes that. hundreds of new industries, trains, cars, ships, stations, literally everything you could think of. one playthrough you could start in the 1700s with horses and sailboats and the next you could roleplay as a businesswoman in 1980s Japan. maybe you wanna reimagine what the tram system is like in London, or roleplay as an American transport company colonizing and rebuilding the world after everyone else gets wiped out.with some configuration and tweaking, any scenario you can dream up is possible in this game.i definitely recommended giving JGR's Patch Pack a looksies, as it expands on OTTD with fantastic QoL and modernization options. it also adds a ton more customizability that should be in the base game, such as allowing you to change how fast time passes and much much more.there's also great game scripts, such as Renewed Village Growth and Busy Bee. unfortunately only one of these game scripts can be active at a time, though. i personally always turn on Renewed Village Growth, as it changes how towns are grown to be much more complex and interesting.the only thing stopping me from playing this game for the rest of time is the knowledge that other games exist. yknow how people have their ""desert island game""? the one they could play forever and not get bored of? this is mine"
OpenTTD,"One of those games where I open it at 3 o'clock, play for a couple minutes, and close it at 8.I don't really enjoy playing against the AI but it's a great virtual trainset."
OpenTTD,"Me parece demasiada información para entrar desde un principio. No soy mucho de juegos de gestión, la verdad."
OpenTTD,It's just a game where I get crazy over pixels growing all over the place
OpenTTD,aga oyun iyi ben böyla oyunları severim ekonomi oyunlarını ama bu oyuna eğitim gibi bi şey gelirse güzel olur amk youtube'den izlerken baynim yanıyo amk
OpenTTD,the local authorities won't let me build in their towns just because I blew up a bunch of houses. orwell predicted this.
OpenTTD,It hurted my brains.
OpenTTD,I respect this game (mostly for being free and looking cool) but not enough to actually learn how the hell to play it...
OpenTTD,"Didn't play much because I never took the time to learn it very well and it lagged a bit on my PC for some reason lol, but is fun. I remember playing online with my friend when a player named Jeff Bezos made everyone bankrupt and monopolized the world. Seems legit."
OpenTTD,Couldn't completely understand how to play but even slowly going bankrupt was fun to watch go down. Kind of encouraging me to look into the sim genre more.
OpenTTD,Oh baby!
OpenTTD,"Es el clásico y mítico Transport Tycoon Deluxe, pero de código abierto, adaptado a equipos modernos y con mogollón de opciones extra. Y lo más importante de todo: es GRATIS, tanto de manera independiente como a través de Steam."

NetHack,tarihi eser büyükbaba max bayılır buna
NetHack,Oh my god can we please get a game like this one with a more modern streamlined approach. What I’d give to experience Nethack in a mentally sane way.
NetHack,Hated farming resources. Also I have spent way too much time on this game...
NetHack,Grade: B (7/10)
NetHack,its more addictive than heroin
NetHack,"I can see the potential and what decades of development on such a ""simplistic"" systemic game can do. I'm just not sure my brain is wired to enjoy it to its full extend.I had few runs but each of them told a story. It's truly a marvel it works this well."
NetHack,"Its actually quite fun once you get over the initial learning curve and play with the wiki open on another tab at all times. And accept that you will never finish it. This game feels like if I was in a real dungeon, id die quick lmao."
NetHack,The difference between using and not using a guide while beating NetHack is a difference of beating it in years or decades
NetHack,Beating this game is on my bucket list.
NetHack,"To say I've ""completed"" this game is to do it a profound disservice. NetHack has been a fixture in my life since the day my dad downloaded it to the family PC (c. 2005) and told me to have at it. I've ascended maybe 15-20 times since then, of thousands of attempts. It's endlessly replayable: to this day, I'm discovering new messages, new outcomes, new strategies, new ways to brutalize my character & lose spectacularly, etc. I've been a capital-G Gamer since the start, burned through hundreds of titles, thousands of hours, several console generations. In that time, gaming technology has advanced spectacularly. Character models are realistic; background visuals astonish. It's a testament to NetHack, then, that its ASCII interface has never lost its flourish. Headcrab zombies, clickers, regeneradores, pyramid head -- still nothing strikes fear into my heart like a lowercase ""a"". Five stars, six stars, a hundred million stars. NetHack my beloved, I'll always come back to you."
NetHack,"Es ist wirklich interessant zu beobachten, welche Charakteristiken des Spiels sich noch in modernen Spielen finden lassen, und welche nicht.Es ist auch sehr amüsant wie das Spiel von der damaligen Nerdkultur beeinflusst wurde, mit Archäologen (im Indiana Jones Stil) und Samurai als spielbare Klassen.Es ist faszinierend zu lernen wie man das Spiel überhaupt steuert und wie die Mechaniken miteinander interagieren. Die Stärke der manigfaltigen Interaktionen wird leider stark durch die limitierte Menge an Wissen, die man über die gefundenen Gegenstände hat limitiert. Es ist schwierig zu experimentieren, wenn man dabei jederzeit plötzlich sterben kann. Eine weitere Mechanik, die man heutzutage nicht mehr in einem Roguelike sieht ist dass der Charakter Level hat welcher sich durch Töten der Monster erhöht. Bin nie wirklich sonderlich weit gekommen, bei so einem langwierigen Unterfangen noch Level zu grinden müssen klingt nicht so erfreulich.Im Gegensatz zu modernen Roguelikes/lites scheint Roleplaying noch ein sehr wichtiger Reiz an dem Spiel gewesen zu sein.Das Spiel ist ein historischer Meilenstein, wenn man ihn aber selbst durchspielen möchte braucht man eine Menge Geduld und eine Resistenz gegen RNG-Pech."
NetHack,"This is as classic as classic can get. This game is a landmark in gaming and, next to the game Rouge, help shaped how people view and make Randomized Dungeon Crawler games.You pick a character, you name them, you pick the class, and off you go. Its so simple to explain but so deep as a game when you actually play it. The goal of this game is to explore a huge dungeon and recover the Amulet of Yendor. Along the way you must fight and survive the ever growing powerful enemy's, and that is nowhere near an understatement because this game is hard as hard can get. If you don't get the gear you need for later floors you WILL get killed very fast and in this game when you die you have to start all over.Its hard but the tools are there to beat it, you just got to learn how the game works and get lucky. I highly suggest you go into this game blind and learn how it works on your own. A true gaming classic."
NetHack,"One of the first few followers in the footsteps of Rogue. If you like rougelikes and are interested in their history, Nethack is cool and you should try it. The key, as with most rougelikes, is to minimize random chance. This ultimately makes Nethack feel like a long series of logic puzzles, as you rub all the items in your inventory together, seeing how they react, and trying to rule out similar looking items that can kill you when you use them. If this sounds annoying, when you get tired of banging your head against the game trying to figure things out for yourself, you can look up a guide and breeze right through it. There’s a handful of tricks to each stratum of the dungeon and the dungeon itself, and if you keep a window open with a list of these tips, Nethack becomes much, much less intimidating."
NetHack,The next evolution of Rogue following on from Hack. It continued to expand upon the roguelike formula while keeping the basic concept in place. It proved just how timeless this gameplay loop is as there are people still paying versions of this in 2024 and will probably continue to do so for a long time to come.
NetHack,i'm sure this is incredibly fun to people who actually know how to play it
NetHack,"i should play this again post-elbereth nerf with all the other changes as those and the general grindy / kaizo-adjacent nature of the game really turned me off when i was getting into the genre. granted, when i was 14, didn't know what a roguelike was, and was racking up bones files in the mines, i was having a pretty good time - you could do worse"
NetHack,"The Dev Team Thinks Of Everything.Except the part where the game is inaccessible, because while the game is predictable enough once you know the outcomes and the fail states... you have a legal binder's worth of rote memorization to conquer if you don't bother with spoilers. So most don't.For example, did you know that walking into a cockatrice corpse is fine, but when you're not wearing gloves and you're blind, you're feeling around and touching the corpse of a petrifying monster? Add that knowledge together, and you'll see why you're being asked if you wanted your possessions identified.Nowadays this kind of gameplay is considered highly-inconvenient and such a thing will not find itself in games that is too focused on QoL."

NetHack,Essential roguelike entry for people who want to play legit roguelike games.
NetHack,"I am very bad at this game. However, this game is special. Getting baited into a treasure room, locked in, and escorted out with all the treasure I took stolen from me is one of the many possibilities in this labyrinth of a game. However this game can get extremely repetitive later on and there are so many alterative like Brogue and ToME that it's a hard sell. Use a full keyboard and allow yourself to be taken for a ride."
NetHack,It is so wonderful
NetHack,brother i am bad
NetHack,"Yo, they have NetHack on here?  Guess I'd better write a review.NetHack is a roguelike (one of the first, in fact) that has existed in a limbo of on-and-off development since 1987.  It has a funny name that means absolutely nothing to a person unaware of its history, being a fairly traditional D&D-inspired dungeon-delver with a few anachronisms and cultural references thrown in for flavor.  But even in spite of how very usual it might seem, it's just a front:  It's a terrifically unhinged experience with a lot of character (literally; the game is typically displayed through ASCII symbols, though there is a graphical tileset if you prefer not having to consult a spreadsheet to have the vaguest idea of what you're looking at).You choose from one of thirteen roles, from such recognizable archetypes as Knight and Wizard to the more unusual like Tourist and Caveman.  You're tasked by your patron deity with plumbing the depths of the Dungeons of Doom, seeking the Wizard of Yendor.  In his grasp lies the legendary Amulet of Yendor, an artifact of untold power, and by bringing it to your god, you can assure their dominance over all other divinities.  In exchange, you will be granted demigodhood, with immortality simply being one perk of the package deal.  And...  That's it.  There's a sort of mini-quest unique to your role that you will need to complete before the game can be won, but otherwise, it's as plain of an excuse plot as it gets.  Go get the Amulet and try not to die along the way.But NetHack doesn't really need any more than that, because while many role-playing games will try to lead you through a defined story, in this game, you write your own.  The lack of real direction means complete freedom to achieve your goals in any way you choose, and NetHack encourages this by giving you a myriad of means by which you can interact with the game world.  Hundreds of items and monsters await you in the depths, all of which react to what you do in surprising and sometimes frankly genius ways.  For your part, you can read, engrave, pray, quaff, eat, wear, chat, ride, throw, rub, apply, tip, kick, etc. etc. This results in an experience where experimentation is key; you can surmount your challenges (or make things worse for yourself) by using your knowledge and ever-growing kit of mundane and magical items in creative ways.  In that respect, while NetHack does have the typical sword-and-spell gameplay you would expect from your standard dungeon crawler, the game ultimately feels more like a puzzle game.  You can say something to it, and very rarely will the game say ""no"" - and if it does, it will assuredly explain to you why.  ""The Dev Team Thinks of Everything"" is a phrase coined in relation to this game, and it really shows.  Everything you can do gets a response, and learning how to manipulate the outcomes in your favor is key to the NetHack experience.But more than likely, things won't work out the way you planned, and you will die.  And being a true roguelike, that means it's all over - Beefsteak the Barbarian is well and truly gone, and somebody else will have to step up and take their place.  Upon returning to the dungeon, you will find that nothing looks familiar anymore.  The layout is completely changed, and even the objects that were once recognizable to you no longer do what you expect.  You will have to rediscover everything, identify the magical artifacts, build your repertoire of skills and items anew, and hope that you learned enough from your previous folly to make it little further this time.  It's punishing, but the sense of discovery and adventure that comes as a result of learning how to survive the alien and treacherous world of the Dungeons is something that is rarely found in games, past or present.  Indeed, it's those unique-to-you experiences that will be the largest motivator to continue forward, outside of simply being able to overcome the game itself.Here are, in no particular order, some of my most notable experiences playing NetHack:- Slipping off my horse and dying within ten turns of starting the game- Donning a cursed Hawaiian shirt and being unable to remove it until an elf very politely burnt it (and me) to a crisp- Torturing a gnome by repeatedly blinding it with a camera- Turning to stone because I bit a cockatrice while polymorphed into a vampire lord- Casually chucking the legendary sword Excalibur into a dark corner because a djinn gave me a cooler weapon- Having a wand of invisibility stolen from me by a nymph and having the rest of my gear subsequently stolen by the now-invisible nymph- Stripping down naked before being beaten mercilessly by a horde of nurses and somehow ending up twice as healthy as before- Praying to my god to save me and being promptly disintegrated for having the gall to pray in Hell- Smashing a cream pie into my face before fighting Medusa to ensure I don't accidentally meet her gaze while stabbing her- And most importantly, ascending for the first timeWhen I beat the game, I had one of the most authentic pop-offs I've ever done in my entire life.  I felt relieved, and frankly proud, because I could say I'd beaten NetHack.  It feels like being part of an exclusive club where everybody knows each other and has plenty of stories to share.  I wanted to get a t-shirt that said ""I Ascended"", knowing full damn well most people would have no idea what it meant, but content that one day I might come across somebody who would say ""hell yeah, brother"" and give me a high-five.  It felt like a legitimate accomplishment, which not many games these days can do.So obviously, I love this game.  Do I recommend it?Well, it really depends.  If you're a person with a good sense of humor who loves experimenting, open-ended sandboxy gameplay, creating your own goals and - most importantly -  dying, you will probably adore this game.  If you're literally anybody else, it's a much harder sell.  Going into NetHack blind is like learning to walk for the first time.  You will realize quickly that while you can do just about anything in NetHack, learning how is the hard part.  Because even once you learn how to move, and how to perform actions, and how to not die from eating rotten food, you will also have to understand that NetHack plays by its own insane rules and it will repeatedly teach you what those are the hard way.  You are going to die over and over again to things that will seem completely unfair and unforeseeable.  The biggest part of improving at playing this game is to understand that success lies in preparing for every possible little thing that can go wrong, so that even your unluckiest moments can be turned around into triumphs.  Almost no game of NetHack is truly unwinnable, and the few that are you probably won't even be aware of because you died long before you could know.  You will learn from your mistakes and, with enough time and patience (and you will need to be patient), succeed in your quest....  But hey, it's 2023, we have busy lives.  I do believe that the less you know about NetHack going into it, the more fun you'll have with it.  By definition, the NetHack community at large tends to consider any mechanics not outright explained in the game's meagre supplementary materials as ""spoilers"".  But you might eventually get just a smidge exasperated trying to decipher each and every little obscure and obtuse mechanic on offer.  So I'll meet you halfway - play the game, get as far as you're willing without looking anything up, and when you find yourself thoroughly perplexed on how to proceed, go check the Wiki.  It's very detailed and will help de-mystify some of the more important core concepts of the game.  That, or you can ask for advice on the NetHack subreddit or Libera IRC channels (if that sounded like a bunch of hoopla, don't worry about it, you're not wrong for being confused).  Your fellow Hackers have a great love for the game and want to see you succeed.  Just don't spoil any more than you have to and only use it as a last resort when you're feeling truly lost.There's something about NetHack that feels remarkably unique.  Taken at face value, it's derivative and seems to pride itself on still feeling like a game from 1987, while similar games in its genre have long since made the leap into the 21st century.  However, it is a genuine labor of love - the end result of people hunching over a computer, asking themselves ""what if"" and then providing an answer for the rest of us.  No two games of NetHack ever feel the same, which is a thing a lot of other video games boast of, but never really seem to deliver on.  It's somehow simultaneously stuck in the past and living far in the future.  I think that's worthy of admiration, even if it's ultimately not your cup of tea.Oh, did I mention it's free?  Make sure to get it from the official site.  Good luck, and go bravely with Lugh."
NetHack,just play caves of qud at this point
NetHack,THIS LICHEN CORPSE IS BANGING YO!
NetHack,"Drank a potion of polymorph, turned into a shark on dry land, and had to spam movement keys for 40 turns until my character died of asphyxiation."
NetHack,"i do not think i am actually done with nethack in any way at the moment, but i'm not sure if there'd be a better time to log it. pioneer of all games, not just roguelikes, in many ways:difficulty.as an early computer game, nethack is not bound to the tyrannical monetary constraints of a typical arcade cabinet; i.e. dying does not cost the player a quarter. as a result, death (and other failures) are allowed to be fun here. the only pressure on the player is whatever pressure they choose themselves to apply. the vast majority of fun, fulfilling hack runs end in abject failure by death. the game uses this to prop up its many, many systems and non sequitur mechanics by designing the game around being fun while not having a clue as to how the game works. as a result, it takes on the story-generator form that we still see in many PC games today: dwarf fortress, rimworld, rust, minecraft, etc. controls.evil-esque keybindings. beautiful. emacs users will burn in hell.community.hand-in-hand with the difficulty here, this game centers one of the best-documented media ""cults"" i've seen. an amazing wiki, age-old chatrooms, forums across the entire web, and rock-solid spoiler.txt files make researching the backend of nethack more than rewarding; the culture of nethack is a valid and legitimate part of the game itself. there are a million more things i could say about why i love nethack, but i'll try to keep it brief. i love that it's FOSS, i love the often incredibly dated pop culture jokes, i love the blatant aping of tolkien lore, i love the extensibility of the software, i love the multiplayer, i love the opaqueness of the game's world and lore, and i love dying stupid deaths. (it will always be a tragedy that I can't track my total playtime across all machines)"
NetHack,"Nethack is hell to play but no other roguelike has managed to take it's place in my heart. It's a perfect intersection to me between system driven bullshit and simple dungeon crawling.Much of the ""hack-likes"" which followed put a larger focus on systemic interactions, especially in a post Dwarf Fortress world. While these are in some ways better at generating emergent stories, I think there's a charm to the more rigid, endless special cases of this game.It does feel like you sometimes just need to do your homework and learn the exact procedure necessary to optimize a process, especially once you delve into reading spoilers. You start to memorize extremely specific processes, like stashing your money in a chest before sitting on a throne, these endless little rituals. To counterbalance, the random loot and character progression standard to RPGs is very simple in this game, and it's very difficult to feel like you're making mistakes. This makes for a game that, once learned, has easy decision making, but difficult execution. It's a form of difficulty that's rare in rpg games, and is more reminiscent of real time arcade games.For a long time, the closest I had to a true win was a Valkyrie on the alt.org server. I had gotten all the way to the end, and attempted the meta strategy of betraying your god for another, and foolishly gave the amulet to my original god anyway. About 8 years later, I managed to get all the way back there and win a run of the game."
NetHack,"If you want to impress me beat a real roguelike, kiddos"
NetHack,I am gonna get that Amulet before I die. this I vow.
