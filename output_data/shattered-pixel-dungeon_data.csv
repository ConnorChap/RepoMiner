## Goal

This PR introduces a couple of changes aiming to:

* reduce duplication
* reduce bugs surface
* safeguard consistent behavior between badges handling

## Changes

### Generic `validate()` method

Instead of multiple methods validating specific badges, new methods are introduced:

* `validate(Badge badge)`
* `validateDeath(Badge badge)`

### Assign and access validation methods to badges enum constants

By default `validate(Badge)` is used to add badge. For death related enum constants this is set to `validateDeath(Badge)`.

### Generic `validateLevels(Map<Badge, Integer> levels, int value)` for leveled badges

Instead of copying same code between multiple validation methods for different badges and between conditional branches, single generic method is introduced. This way consistent approach is guaranteed.

### Introduce `CollectionUtils`

As for now it contains these basic utility functions:

```java
public static <T> List<T> filter(Iterable<T> collection, Predicate<T> condition)
public static <T> T getFirst(Iterable<T> collection, Predicate<T> condition)
public static <T> boolean allMatch(Iterable<T> collection, Predicate<T> condition)

// helpers for creation of immutable maps
public static <K, V> MapBuilder<K, V> mapBuilder()
public static <K, V> MapBuilder<K, V> linkedMapBuilder()
```

`filter`, `getFirst` and `allMatch` allow avoiding duplicated loops as in

```java
// instead of a loop copied in multiple places, allMatch hides it (internally it is still a loop)
boolean allUnlocked = allMatch(firstBossClassBadges.values(), Badges::isUnlocked);

// instead of for (Catalog cat : Catalog.values()) { if (allSeen(cat)) { ... }}
// filter returns a list of elements that match condition
filter(Catalog.catalogs(), Catalog::allSeen)
```

### Introduce `maybeDisplayBadge(Badge badge, Predicate<Badge> condition)`

Current code duplicates 6 lines for a conditional badge display. This helper method removes duplication so resulting code looks like this:

```java
maybeDisplayBadge(Badge.PIRANHAS, b -> Statistics.piranhasKilled >= 6);
```

## What now

All these changes remove 180 lines of code net.

I'd like to ask what do you think about this approach. If you think this may be a valuable change, I will 

* experiment with writing unit tests evidencing these changes did not break anything
* document and format changes a bit

But I want to ask you about your opinion do you actually want this change.
