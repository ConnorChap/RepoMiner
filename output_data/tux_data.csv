To do this we added some variables to the Config, added a new Controller that serves as a dummy for the online handling of the character, added a new menu, a new class for ip management and another for sending and receiving messages.

This messages use the UDP protocol and threads to make a peer to peer connection for the handling of the LAN communication.

We only did LAN communication as other types of communication would require a server and this would require money or other resourses that we dont think the suppertux community wants, although there is a way to use this program for true online multiplayer, all it takes is putting the public ip of the host and both who is joining and who is hosting need to forward their routters to their computers.

Changes:
- When a collision against a shallow slope is detected (0 < slope_normal.x < 0.7), the enemy is manually nudged upward slightly.
- Otherwise, if the slope is steep or it's a wall, the enemy turns around as usual.

Testing:
- Reproduced the original stuck behavior in a sandbox level.
- After applying the fix, enemies now smoothly turn around properly on curved tiles without getting stuck.
- Regression tested normal wall collisions and enemy behavior across different tile types via playing a couple levels.

* Make the chasing fish use 4 different rotations instead of just 2.
* A better interoperability between vectors and directions. There should be at least functions to obtain a unit vector from direction and a direction from vector.

**List of actions as of now:**
- idle (normal + pinch)
- scream (normal + pinch)
- charge (normal + pinch)
- busted

**Explainiation of planned behavior change (for coders):**
The Ghost Tree will start begin the battle with a scream, spawning wisps that **DO NOT** hurt Tux. After which it will suck in the wisps (use scream action for now) and initiate the proper color-coated attacks with another scream. During all this the Main Root Attack is instigated on occasion, behaving essentially like a Root Sapling root attack.

During full health (5 HP) the Ghost tree only makes use of the Red Root Attack. During 4 HP, the Green Root Attack. 3 HP, the Blue Root Attack etc. When all colored attacks are completed, the Ghost Tree will go into its recharge action revealing its core. That core Tux can jump on to land a hit on the Ghost Tree, after which the Ghost Tree hides its core again.


**Pinch Mode:**
During Pinch Mode the Ghost Tree will loose it's branches, do a scream, spawn all 3 colors of wisps and swallow them -> do another scream and initiate the Pinch Root Attack multiple times.

- - -

**Red Root Attack:**
- A wave of red glowing roots will emerge from the ground, (from the side furthest from Tux's position relative to the Ghost Tree) going from one end to the other.

**Green Root Attack:**
- Spawn a green glowing Root at Tux's latest position which hurt Tux on touch as well as explodes when touched or after a few seconds, bursting into smaller Root Spikes that break upon touching the ground.

**Blue Root Attack:**
- Spawns a ""Granito"" Root at Tux's latest position that after reaching max height, shoots one blue glowing Root Dart out of each Granito head before retracting back into the ground (there's two variants - those can be randomized)

**Pinch Root Attack:**
- Combines aspects of all attacks. A Pinch Root will spawn at Tux's latest position out of which a wave of red glowing roots emerge on both sides, shoot a blue glowing Root Dart on both sides and the Root itself explodes into Root Darts soon after.

The following videos show a scripted example of each Root Attack:

Currently, only one object can be set as ignore object for the collision system. This is alright when we want to prevent self-collisions. However, sometimes multiple objects need to be ignored. For example in case of ledge behaviour where we want to prevent badguys from assuming players can be walked on.

Therefore, I changed `GameObject* ignore_object` to `const std::vector<GameObject*>&`.

Furthermore, I've changed the code to ignore players when checking whether the badguy may fall because we don't want badguys to consider players as suitable target for continuing to walk when their ledge behaviour is set to stay on the platform.

  - upon defeat, the yeti will stumble backwards for a bit before falling to the ground, remaining there instead of falling off-screen.
- [x] ""fall"" action is added for when the Yeti falls or his jump loses altitude.
- [x] Big Snowball projectile spawn position must be adjusted to fit animation.
  - Same may apply to the Bouncy Snowball spawn position
- [x] Upon entering pinch mode, Yeti shall play his ""rage"" action, beating his chest, to signify to the player that his pinch mode has started.

Minor behavior adjustments (recommandations):
- [x] Big Snowball the Yeti throws should bounce (feels more dynamic that way).
- [x] Reduce amount of Big Snowballs thrown from 3 to 2 on last health (it's odd how he goes from 1 to 3 between second to last and last health).
~~- In Pinch Mode, instead of walking from one end to the other, Yeti will jump towards the center of the arena, stand still (while the stomp animation plays), allowing for an attack and soon after jump towards the other end of the arena.~~ (postponed)

With this PR, by settings a single SDL2 Renderer hint, this should result in a possible major performance boost!

They also mention on the docs that it is disabled by default due to some potential issues with usage of rendering, but after some pretty general testing, I did not spot any in particular. I would appreciate some testers that want to boot a build up and see if it at least draws stuff.

## Remove `CollisionListener` class

The changes done by commit fa82f91f84e4aab98fc16008d60b9838984996b5 have been reverted. The reason is that `CollisionListener` was not used as a base anywhere beside `MovingObject`, and made it so `CollisionObject::collide()`/`collision()` had to use `dynamic_cast` to side-cast the `other` object's listener to a `GameObject`.

`CollisionObject` now contains the `MovingObject& m_parent` member, as opposed to `CollisionListener& m_listener`.

2163932483,Remodel Many Autotilesets as Autotileset-Corners,Eauix,2024-11-05 21:20:58+00:00,2024-12-27 20:04:48+00:00,{},"Many tilesets have layouts whose autotilesets would work better as autotileset corners (similar to the snow and forest background tilesets present in levels). So, this request is focused on rewriting A LOT of autotilesets in the form of corners, so they are drawn in a more natural and less annoying or broken way.

### Rewritten autotilesets on Worldmaps:

- [x] Every ""Land"" and ""Ceiling"" tileset
- [x] Thin ice, Snow Layers, Ice Holes, Trees and other embellishment tiles.

### Rewritten autotilesets on Levels:
- [x] Every ""Hole"" tileset
- [x] Snow Unisolid 1 and 2
- [x] Forest and Corrupted Forest Bushes

### Tweaks and New Features:
- [x] Extra tile images for Worldmaps
- [x] Updated Worldmap strf
- [x] Extra tile images for Levels
- [x] Updated Level strf
- [x] Autotileset for Poles and Goals
- [x] Lightmap tiles for Worldmaps
- [x] Autotiles for some more Worldmap decorations (Cave pillares, forest bushes, rocks, crystals and lily pads)
- [x] Autotilesets for Lightmaps
- [x] Rename some autotilesets
- [x] Move some tiles to background tilegroups
- [x] (Experimental) Autotiles for Diagonal Poles 

### Notes:
* The `corrupted_forest_transition` autotileset will not be made into an autotileset-corner, because they do not interfer on tiles from other autotilesets, and this transition works better by replacing forest tiles.

* ~The ""Hole"" autotilesets will no longer be rewritten as corners due to an issue where a tile that is present both in an autotileset and in an autotileset-corner doesn't change properly when erasing.~
* Update: the issue has been fixed, so they will be rewritten"

For example: `libphysfs` requires manually copying the DLL on Windows (as well on Linux), but I've personally had linking issues on OpenSUSE. I've unfortunately just never succeeded in building this game.

It was planned to be a rewrite, and it kind of is, but it's mostly just axing stuff from the current files. It will need plenty of testing.

#### TODO

- [x] Remove `Supertux2_lib` and `Supertux2_c`
- [x] Switch to find_package for things that can be a find_package
- [x] Use find_package for `external` stuff when needed
- [x] Linux support with PkgConfig/find_package
- [x] Switch from GoogleTest to CMakeTest
- [x] ""Cherrypick"" #3001
- [x] MacOS (need someone to test this all)
- [x] Windows installer
- [x] Arabic language support
- [x] Delete unused CMake files
- [ ] Rigorous testing

It ~~(will soon)~~ also removes the `Supertux_lib` split, making the tests instead depend on the specific files being tested, as well as using CMake's built-in testing functionality instead of GoogleTest."

Finding all objects inheriting a given base class (like BadGuy, Portable, or PathObject) required scanning through the entire list of objects and trying a `dynamic_cast` on each. This PR changes the map to, for a given GameObject, record it in `m_objects_by_type_index` for all its notable intermediate base classes. Thus, for example, a Lantern is registered in the `m_objects_by_type_index` map for the lists for type indexes corresponding to Lantern, Rock, Portable, MovingSprite, and MovingObject. Now, one can efficiently look up all e.g. Portable objects by querying `m_objects_by_type_index[std::type_index(typeid(Portable))]`, and this will be fast even if the level has 10000 unrelated objects.

In practice, this PR significantly speeds up processing for the Player and Crusher classes, which no longer need to search through many unrelated objects when looking for e.g. other players, Bullets, Portables, Bricks, etc. (A test level that I made with many crushers and about 1000 coins, which used to lag, now runs quickly.)

The awkward part of this approach is identifying the various base classes of an object when it is time to register them in `GameObjectManager::this_before_object_add()`. This is done by adding a new virtual function to `GameObject`, which when called provides all the classes under which to record an object. Every class inheriting GameObject must then implement the method to add itself to its own list. (This is admittedly tedious, but the method body is only a very formulaic line.)

This supersedes but does not conflict with https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/pull/2986 .

This PR makes dispensers active in terms of being an active/inactive badguy always.  This is beneficial for many reasons:
1) Dispensers don't really function as badguys anyway, moreso as other objects, which are always active.
2) It fixes the bug where dispensers scripting would break if you went away from the dispenser and then came back.
3) I believe it fixes an unreported issue where gravity-obeying dispensers would fall into the void if they were placed on moving platforms because the dispenser would load below/inside/off the moving platform because the platform was moving and the dispenser wasn't.

However, I know this could be considered kind of a cheap/non-optimal solution to the bug.  So if anyone has any better suggestions feel free to take a look at it."

The fix is to look up the singleton objects using (ultimately) the `m_objects_by_type_index` map.

(SuperTux still has a bunch of other performance issues of this type; `GameObjectManager::get_object_count` and `GameObjectManager::get_objects_by_type` are other functions that are called too often and will search the full object list instead of using `m_objects_by_type_index` or an equivalent. Long term, I'd also recommend replacing `m_objects_by_type_index` with a vector indexed by an integer type ids.)"

## PCH

PCH makes builds 50% to 66% faster. A simple `time make -j$(nproc)` on my 12-core CPU shows:
```
With PCH:
real    0m58.048s
user    5m33.425s
sys    1m56.666s

Without PCH:
real    1m50.533s
user    15m20.049s
sys    2m56.815s
```

`real` is the total time spent, from start to finish, as perceived by the developer. `user` is the sum of the time spent by each thread, which gives a better idea of what would happen on a single-threaded system. [Details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/556405/what-do-real-user-and-sys-mean-in-the-output-of-time1)

IPO makes Release builds 15% smaller. I have not tested the runtime performance.

> These values never change after a program is linked, so it is safe to cache the uniform and attribute locations. In addition to the obvious benefit (fewer function calls), calling glGet-type functions inhibits OpenGL driver optimizations: if there is a mixture of setting/getting commands, drivers cannot do batch optimizations where they accumulate a bunch of commands and process them all of them at once, since it is possible one command could affect the output of a glGet-type function, whose results are needed immediately.

The last glGet-type function that SuperTux calls a lot is `glGetError()`; however, I have not removed it, because it is useful when developing and debugging code. I believe there are more efficient ways to debug OpenGL (see https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Debug_Output ) than glGetError, but a) haven't looked into them in detail b) think this is already a strict improvement.

This change reduces the number of instructions that I see executed when running the title screen for ten seconds. Running `perf stat -- timeout 10 supertux2` a few times to estimate the amount of CPU work done, I measured:

Right now all they are planned to be is a re-skin for the **Swimming Fish** and **Chasing Fish** badguy, without any behavior changes as of now. I couldn't quite decided on anything.

However, to not postpone their inclusion any longer, I'd say we simply add them as an object types for the mentioned entities and add worry about a potential behavior change later.

1810455925,[NOSQUASH] Editor: Replace the OKLab color picker by a 2D color picker,HybridDog,2024-04-06 15:57:07+00:00,2024-10-31 19:22:32+00:00,"{'involves:editor': 1, 'category:code': 1, 'status:needs-review': 1}","# Goal

There are reports that the one-dimensional OKLab color selection is unpopular and difficult to use (see [this Discussion](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/discussions/2323)),
so we can remove it to simplify the code and GUI.

A two-dimensional image can enable a more convenient selection of colors than a one-dimensional slider.
Under the assumption that users typically want to select a color with the highest saturation,
a two-dimensional color picker where any RGB color with the highest saturation can be slected with one click could be suitable.
For an independent adjustment of lightness and hue, which is considered a good property of a color picker,
the two-dimensional color picker should use a perceptual color space such as OKLab.
As a side effect for choosing a perceptual color space,
a marker showing the lightness and hue of the current color can visualize how a change in RGB values affects the perceived color.


# Proposed changes

* For the color selection in the editor, add the ItemColorPicker2D menu item,
  which displays an image and enables picking a color from it by clicking.
  The image contains the highest-saturation sRGB colors,
  so for the color picker we only need OKLab code to determine marker positions
  and no color clipping code since we can sample pixels from the image.
* Add a method drawing a hexagon to Canvas
* Add a helper method to ColorOKLCh which calculates a modified lightness
* Add a missing include guard and constness to the code for ColorOKLCh
* Remove ItemColorChannelOKLab and most of the OKLab color space code.
  Since the two-dimensional color picker uses some of the OKLab code,
  it is not removed completely.


# Additional information

The author of OKLab has a webpage about a color picker, which uses [a modified lightness](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker/#intermission---a-new-lightness-estimate-for-oklab).
I have also used the modified lightness since it leads to smaller dark regions in the color picker image and in SuperTux it is, I assume, uncommon to select dark colors (correct me if I'm wrong).

Color picker image with unmodified lightness:
![out_L](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/assets/3192173/ccf61c21-24e9-49a4-bc64-c57fa407f551)

Color picker image with modified lightness:
![out_Lr](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/assets/3192173/ea7869a8-2b4e-40e9-a28f-475badd888f7)

The new color picker with default language and 800x600 window size:
![2024-04-06-174514_335x540_scrot](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/assets/3192173/8d56fdbe-0f3d-4637-b757-ce757e70c2e9)

The color picker stretches horizontally; since the language affects the width of the menu title, the color picker's aspect ratio depends on the language. I don't think this is a problem, so I haven't implemented it differently.

I couldn't find a way to get a pixel from a Surface, so the color picker image is loaded twice: one time for the drawing and one time to sample pixel values from it.

Please test the new color picker."

Pressing an object directly adds it to the sector.

![image](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/assets/78196474/cc3d0652-a464-4def-8ac6-6cfda7e86378)

To achieve this, most of the `EditorToolboxWidget` code, which managed tile/object selection, was moved to a different class. The resulting `EditorTilebox` class can also be used for features like tile backpacks in the future.

Additionally, this PR allows objects to be moved around right after the editor is started (without an objectgroup having to be active).

Included in this PR are the following:
- Rocks no longer hurt Tux and bounce off of him, making rock puzzles more fair.
- Rocks now interact as expected with slick ice, water, bumpers, and trampolines.
- Enemies now interact as expected with water, bumpers, and trampolines. 
- Objects oriented to the side (switches, darttraps, bumpers, stalactites, yeti stalactites, pushbuttons, ispys, and shards) now properly stick to moving objects which look like they can be stuck to (moving tilemaps, platforms, crushers and fallblocks). [Fixes #1782]

Note: I was hoping to incorporate some more general method for point 4, where I didn't have to specify every single interaction and I could just label some objects as ""sticky"" and ""sticked"" objects, but this proved to be difficult as I don't think the game is currently capable of describing objects in such a way that I could do that, and I did not want to spend this PR refactoring some part of the game just to include that little thing.  Each of the different possible interactions tends to have to some slight variation from one another, and there aren't very many of these possible interactions, anyway.

Their behavior will be a mixture of its old behavior and that of a **Crusher**!

Tarantula will reside idle on the ceiling, only charging downwards if Tux is close. Once they dropped down towards the floor, they will now bounce up and down within a set distance from the ground for as long as Tux remains close to it. Once Tux leaves, Tarantula will begin to slowly move up towards its original resting place and wait until Tux gets close again.

Most important feature of this library in the context of SuperTux is the ability to easily expose functions, classes (which can include properties) and other entries to Squirrel in one or a few lines.

Every exposed class, variable and function has been migrated to incorporate this change. As a result, the `scripting/` directory, which included all scripting functions, classes and variables, as well as the API wrapper, has been removed, since it is no longer needed for the new binds.

Some scripting functions have been deprecated (currently only via a tag in comment, later to be migrated to docmentation) for several reasons:
* Some `get_` and `set_` functions have been deprecated, since a class property has been added and should replace their usage.
* Functions with the names `get_pos_x` or `get_pos_y` have been replaced with `get_x` and `get_y` for consistency, thus are now deprecated.

This way of creating Squirrel binds would allow for way more flexibility in exposing functions, classes and properties.

**Additionally:**

* Removed the `camera()` function, as it only printed the camera position, which is already accessible through methods from the `Camera` itself.
* `Granito` and `GranitoBig` are now scriptable.

## Documentation

Doxygen scripting documentation is now generated for the entire codebase as well, since scripting classes might be found anywhere.

The `@scripting` tag for classes, functions, constants and variables indicates the item should be added to the scripting documentation. Otherwise, it should be ignored.

Added support for the following:

* Enumerators
* Member variables
* Listing of base and derived classes

CMake's `fixup_bundle` does not recognise install names with `@rpath`, so it fails while bundling `libjxl_cms` as `libjxl`'s dependency. Make CMake happy by changing its install name to a full path instead.

* It can be coded better as a whole, utilizing features like PhysFS file reading/writing using `ReaderMapping`/`Writer` (would also prevent security issues, like #2398).
* It is made very hidden from the regular user.
* The previous points can be fixed without a problem, but regardless, I have personally never seen anyone use this feature, or have interest in it. I also do not see any practical use for it currently, other than for TAS-es (tool-assisted speedruns), but for that purpose, there is already special software which can do much more and is better suited for that purpose, like libTAS.

All in all, I believe this feature could be re-implemented in the future with newer code and could serve a purpose: for example, an idea I had is to have live add-on preview levels, which can utilize ""movie files"" from such feature, and play just like a video.

Feel free to leave a comment if you believe I have missed something in regards to this feature, or disagree on this removal proposal.

Setting a custom color for the light sprite is also possible, as long as the object is not designed to use foreign color values (for example, from an option).

To add a light sprite with an RGB color of `0.5, 0.2, 0.25`, in a `.sprite` file:

```
(linked-sprites
  (light ""path/to/light/sprite"" 0.5 0.2 0.25)
)
```

Keep in mind that specifying color values is optional. The entry can also end after specifying the file.

**Additionally:**

* Objects which utilize more than 1 sprite are now able to get the files of their additional sprites from the main one's `linked-sprites` list (the same block where `light` sprites can also be added, as shown above). This allows for expanded sprite customization for objects.

To add linked sprites, in a `.sprite` file:

```
(linked-sprites
  (key ""path/to/sprite"")
  (key2 ""another/sprite/file"")
)
```

Linked sprites can be added under sprite actions, too. If a sprite with the same key is found in the general linked sprites block and the action-specific one, the sprite specified by the action will be prioritized, thus overriding the default linked sprite file.

Sprites, which the specific object does not support, will be ignored.

* Sprite actions now support the `flip-offset` property, which determines how much the sprite should be vertically offset when flipped vertically.

**Behavior:**
Root Sapling is permanently exposed, unlike Mole, and does not throw rocks. Instead Root Sapling spawns small roots pointing upwards (like Ghost Tree) underneath the player every couple seconds - one at a time. The root attack will only stop until the player either leaves its attack range or kills it by jumping on its head/core. It's attack radius would be quite large - big enough that it can roughly attacks you as long as it is on screen. 20 tiles might be enough, maybe.

**Root Attack:**
Underneath the player's last position, a small hill spawns (with partilces popping up to help visualizing where/when it spawned and a second after the root pokes out, retracting shortly after - then despawning. Another root may appear with a 2 second cooldown.

This enemy will (hopefully) give players a point of reference when eventually facing the Ghost Tree, as the current plan for how to damage it will be shared with Root Sapling - hitting its core by jumping on it!

They are also semi-smart, i.e. if there is ave ground to stand, they will drop of ledges otherwise they will simply turn around. If there is a wall in their path and the wall is low enough, they will jump over it! Otherwise, again, they just turn around.

And as a little bonus, if they see Tux close by they will also wave at him once and look up at the player if he stand on-top of their head :)

Giant Granito are merely meant as a background object. They simply sit around and don't really react to anything happening.

Due to the conversion from floating point to integer values, there was a ""build-up"" of rounding errors when splitting gradients to single-colour rectangles for rendering, which caused that some of the rectangles would overlap by one pixel. This PR adds a check that ensures that the next step always starts at previous step + previous height/width (both of those are already integers), plus it always shortens the height/width by one when the rounding error exceeds one (checks the actual position of the rectangle calculated by adding the width/height of the previous one to its starting position against the position calculated directly using the floats), so the gradient isn't stretched. This is the point at which the overlap would previously occur.
This bug was introduced in #2549 . I didn't notice it because the overlap can only be seen when the overlapping rectangles change the rendering outcome, i.e. when using the Additive blend mode.

Now, the `Level` instantiates all `Player`s in the ""main"" sector, and each sector, on activation, moves those players to itself, so it can manage them, essentially making players global for the level. This allows retaining the full state of all players, between sectors.

Any grabbed/carried object by a player is also moved between sectors, together with the player.

Additionally, a fix for the slow moving animation of grabbed objects, when teleporting while carrying them, is included. Carried objects now teleport together with the player.

This PR removes all hard-coded coordinates and offsets in `darttrap.cpp`, now the darts will always spawn in the centre of the hitbox's height (width for up and down darts). This makes it much more intuitive to create custom sprites for DartTrap. The default sprite is adjusted for this in a way that won't affect existing levels.
It also makes it possible to change the sprite of the dispensed Dart from DartTrap's menu in the editor.
Darts and DartTraps now also support UP and DOWN directions, in addition to LEFT and RIGHT.
This PR also cleans up `darttrap.cpp`/`hpp` according to the guidelines, namely adding the `m_` prefix to member variables.

- Removes the dependency on VCPKG entirely, due to conflicts between VCPKG and Emscripten
- Adds an optional submodule target for GLM
- Moves CMake code relative to dependencies into their dependency files (mk/cmake/SuperTux/Provide*.cmake)
- Updates (and significantly simplifies) the build steps for WASM
- Fixes a compilation error in `#ifdef EMSCRIPTEN`-guarded code
- Allows using the latest version of Emscripten (3.something) instead of the old 1.40 branch
- Removes the need to patch SDL_ttf, and adds an option to use the builds provided by Emscripten
- Updates the workflow files to reflect those changes

Closes #2500 

(Assuming this PR was open to help WASM builds)

--------------

### Removes dependency on VCPKG

The VCPKG builds are difficult to maintain because the ports are unstable (community-driven) and VCPKG-specific functionalities seem to impede on Emscripten settings. Since it wasn't too much trouble, I replaced any remaining dependency with builtin Emscripten ports or submodules.

### Adds an optional submodule target for GLM

A consequence of removing VCPKG. Surprisingly, this is the only submodule I needed to add. This should not affect other platforms, which can still use system-provided GLM.

### Refactor Emscripten=specific CMake code

Most notably, it moves dependency code within the dependency files (`mk/cmake/SuperTux/Provide*.cmake`). This slims down the monstruous lines at the beginning of the files, and makes it easier to identify Emscripten-related dependency code.

### Removes the need to patch SDL_ttf

A small one, but the SDL_ttf dependency no longer needs patching. By default, Emscripten will compile with the builtin SDL_ttf, but there is still the option of building the SDL_ttf dependency manually, and it works without patching now.

### Significantly simplifies building for WASM

The removal of VCPKG and the better CMake configuration mechanisms allow for a much simpler workflow: instead of the bazillion options that needed to be manually set throughout the process, the build flow is now a simple `cmake`-`make`-`emrun`.

This is mostly a consequence of the other fixes above, but it's satisfying to convert an overly complex system into a simple, straightforward one.

The `INSTALL.md` file has been updated to reflect those changes.

### Allows using the latest version of Emscripten

The old workflow was stuck on 1.40.1, which has been deprecated almost as soon as SuperTux got its WASM ports (quite a while now). I made the compilation process available on the latest version of the Emscripten SDK.

### Fixes a compilation error

Part of the code that is guarded with `#ifdef EMSCRIPTEN` has missed review due to the failing builds, so I fixed the code. Please let me know if there is any other Emscripten-specific code that would need attention.

### Updates the workflow files to reflect those changes

Speaking of workflow, the nightlies should be up again for WASM. I'll keep an eye on the CI builds and fix any error that might come up."

### Behavior
Corrupted Snail will behave just like normal Snail, however every ~8 seconds they will stand still and reveal spiky roots poking out of their helmet. During that, jumping on them hurts Tux and leaves the badguy unharmed. Corrupted Snail will remain spiky for ~3 seconds until its spiky roots will retract and they continue walking along as normal.

When Corrupted Snail stops, the **shake** action will play once, followed by the **guard** action. As long as the **guard** action plays, Corrupted Snail will be harming Tux on touch and cannot be stomped. When they return to their normal state, the **retract** action will play once before Corrupted Snail begins to walk normally (like how their waking animatoin plays before walking along).

_I made a quick little demonstration of how I envision Corrupted Snail to work in-game (using a Scripted Object):_

The idea is that Tux starts moving with his walking animation until he reaches max speed. Once the walk animation has played its last frame when at max speed. Tux's run animation will start playing until he gets slower. Exception would be moments like the ""level end sequence"" or his main menu appearence where Tux should always play the walking animation due to the speed at which he walks in so instances.

- [x] Things left to do is a transition frame from ""standing"" to ""walking"" and from ""walking"" to ""running"" for a smoother transition.

The reason this bug occurs is because instead of getting the current worldmap, the function `scripting::get_game_object_manager()` returns the current sector from the editor instead. This is what causes the objects to not be found, thus triggering the ""dead objects"" scripting error.

This PR swaps the check for a current worldmap with the one for the current sector, by prioritizing the current worldmap. Upon testing, it seems to be working fine with levels, loaded from the worldmap, worldmaps, loaded from the editor, and other cases similar to these. There may be a better way to solve this issue in general, though.

Another change featured in this PR is that instead of `scripting::GameObject`s storing UIDs of their exposed parents, and afterwards having to search through the whole current `GameObjectManager` for their parent object, they now store a pointer to their parent `GameObject`, which is more optimized."
1187641489,Fix partial ungrab listener problem (segfault),Semphriss,2023-01-06 06:04:56+00:00,2023-03-18 07:44:16+00:00,"{'category:code': 1, 'type:bugfix': 1}","Fixes #2362

Prior to this commit, there was in player.hpp a function `stop_grabbing()` seemingly similar in function to `ungrab_object()`, except that it did not handle the ObjectRemoveListeners properly, which could result in dangling pointers. This was fixed by making the former simply call the latter. This may not be a proper fix (I'm not sure if there was an important, intended difference between the functions, but it's the kind of bug I see often in the game).

An example of this bug occurs with the Ice Block: Open any level with an ice cube and at least 1 other (generic) badguy, stomp and grab the cube, approach the other badguy and collide with it so that they both die, but __without ungrabbing the ice cube__; then, before the ice cube falls off the screen, quickly press escape and restart the level, and then restart the level again.

(I'm not sure why restarting _twice_ is necessary, might be another bug)"

The fire hat was 1 pixel too high, and the ice hat was 2 pixels too high compared to the walking animation.

* An **add-on previewing menu**, which shows an add-on's description, type, license and available screenshot previews (if ""Show Screenshots"" is chosen). It is accessible when an add-on from the add-on browsing or installed add-ons menus is chosen. A text saying ""No description available."" appears, when no description is specified for the add-on.

The main add-ons menu now shows all installed add-ons. An installed add-on can be previewed and managed with the following options: ""Update"" (if an update is available), ""Uninstall"" and an ""Enabled"" toggle. Add-ons available for download only contain an ""Install"" option under their preview.

The coin path has been designed to:
- Looks like a parabola, indicating clearly that this is a jump
- Be reproducible both as small and big Tux with the same ease
- Be compatible with different gameplay styles: with or without momentum, hitting the bumper in the middle or on either edge, jumping on the trampoline a few times before jumping, hesitations, etc. Note that the range the possible jumps cover is too wide for the coins to be placed in such a way to cover all of them; I favored rewarding the most comfortable-looking path.

I encourage people to test those changes to see if it feels comfortable enough to use.

I chose to retain the same number of coins and not to adjust the trampoline height to keep changes at a minimum and to retain a user experience as close as possible to the original intent. If it is not considered important, I can adjust the trampoline height to avoid having Tux partially clipping out of the sector from jumping on the trampoline.

Note that this design involves code both in the LevelTime object and in the GameSession class; this is necessary because taking the checkpoint coins is handled directly in player.cpp, which happens at the moment of dying, not resetting. I would welcome a proposal that would help fix this, if any.

This also fixes a bug with the timer running despite all players being either dead, dying of winning."

That's because Android GL hardware cannot handle the amount of triangles that SuperTux pushes each frame.
This optimization will calculate the adjacent tiles into a bigger rectangle, and render them together as two GL triangles, with the repeating texture.
There is also a script update-tilecache.sh which will launch SuperTux with each level, which will calculate the big rectangles and save them into .local/share/supertux2/tilecache so the levels will load faster.
On the worldmap on ""The Journey Begins"" level this optimization reduces the amount of GL triangles from 8500 to 2860, and increases FPS from 6-7 to 43-48, when measured on my Poco X3 Pro, which is actually a gaming phone, but nowhere near a gaming laptop in terms of GL triangles output.
On the Forest worldmap on the level ""Tower of Ghosts"" FPS is 9-11, and 7-8 inside the level. With the optimization, FPS is 46-52 on the worldmap, and 39-42 inside the level.
Android app is compiled with LTO enabled. Without LTO, FPS drops miserably even with the GL optimization.

809919995,Tiles from other tilesets can now be imported from the strf files,Narre,2021-12-25 18:15:58+00:00,2022-01-11 15:23:42+00:00,{},"Fixes #325

Implements tile importing in the way Grumbel suggested in the issue. This only imports tiles, since tilegroups would be full of non-imported tiles (therefore holes) and the user may want to define their own tilegroups anyway. Similarly, autotiles may depend on non-imported tiles and are therefore not imported.

The most obvious use case for this feature is that if a player wants to add custom tiles into their add-on while keeping the vanilla tiles.strf tiles, they previously had to either redefine tiles.strf (which broke a lot of stuff when the add-on was used), or to create a new strf file and copy all the contents of tiles.strf manually, which could break if tiles.strf got updated (for example, an image was changed and the existing ids were remapped to the new image). Now the player could just create a new strf, import tiles they need, add their own and mix & match them all into their own tilegroups.

Note: a full tileset (with no limit and no offset) can be imported using (start 0)(end 0)(offset 0) - this will also import autotiles and tilegroups, however, if new tiles are then added into the imported tileset, the user may redefine their ids by having used them before

Please test! I haven't had time to throw every possible problem at it (like offsets making the tiles go below 1, and other edge cases). I will test this myself later today, but the more people test it, the better!\
_edit:_ I have now tested (and fixed) a few things (see the commits)

example: if I want to make an add-on, and I need to add two tiles, I can now just make a strf that looks like this:

```
(supertux-tiles
  (import-tileset
    (file ""images/tiles.strf"")
    (start 0)   ;; I want the tiles from the beginning
    (end 4326)  ;; This is the last tile in the file at this time. I will use the higher ids myself
    (offset 0)  ;; I want the tiles to retain their original ids without an offset
  )
  (tiles
    (image ""images/tiles/my_tiles.png"")
    (ids 4327 4328)
    (attributes ...)
    (data ...)
  )
  (import-tileset
    (file ""images/tiles.strf"")
    (start 4327) ;; New tiles were added since made this tileset, I want to import them (the new ones only)
    (end 4400)   ;; This is the current last id
    (offset 2)   ;; Since I have already used two ids for my tiles, I need to offset these tiles by 2
  )
)
```

I would need to define tilegroups and autotiles manually, but it's still less tedious than defining everything manually and I would be able to mix my new tiles into them.
If you have any better ideas for tilegroup and/or autotile importing, please tell me. Thank you."

This is because the code that handles jumping while climbing is not the same as the usual one, and it forgot to handle the early apex.
Steps to reproduce the bug:
- In a level, navigate to a location with a tall climbable zone with walkable land below it
- Go right below the climbable zone
- Start jumping and hold, as to do a high jump
- Before reaching the apex, interrupt your jump (as if you changed your mind and wanted to do a small jump), and immediately after (not before, after), press and hold up to start climbing
- From there, attempt to do a high jump. Prior to this commit, it would fail and force the early apex on you; after, it will do a high jump, as expected.

These were meant to assist in autotiling, but it turned out to be much more complicated and now I'm working on tools to help me do them. In the meantime, I leave the files here so the community can use them before the new autotile system is finished.

I extended the colour picker in the level editor so that colours can be chosen in the perceptual [OkLab ](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) colourspace (actually L, C, h and not L, a, b). The user can change the lightness, chroma or hue with the mouse or keyboard. The colour is gamut clipped to fit in sRGB.
Here's a video of the colour picker:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3192173/132095026-171b4941-e0c1-4d25-a9ea-4e8cec6e9137.mp4


## To Do

* Test if there are bugs (I'm the only one who tested it so far)
* Code style fixes if needed


## Additional information

### Hue Selection Gamut Clipping

I tried different gamut clipping methods for the hue selection:
![hues_preserved_lightness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3192173/132094697-bb222456-18d6-486f-9bda-dba93b9fada8.png)
![hues_project_to_adaptive_l0_l_cusp_0 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3192173/132094698-570af826-33b9-47fd-b6ca-f5e10373f558.png)
![hues_project_to_l_half](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3192173/132094699-e748f36e-a481-4ff2-9aba-14aa6539c779.png)
![hues_preserved_chroma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3192173/132094696-4fb0846b-9eef-4826-b0bc-4c5fccb6d5f2.png)
The pictures correspond to following methods:
* Preserve lightness
* Adaptive L0, hue dependent, alpha=0.5 (currently implemented)
* Project towards (L0, C0) = (0.5, 0)
* Preserve chroma

- Two new crystallo variants: Roof Crystallo and Sleeping Crystallo.  Roof Crystallo walks along the roof and drops down when it sees Tux, shattering into 4 shards that the crystallo splits into after hitting the ground, flying in the air, and sticking to the ground and wall where they landed for a few seconds before despawning.  Sleeping Crystallo sleeps peacefully in a sleeping area above the ground but when it becomes aware of Tux it jumps out of its sleeping place and walks around normally.

Reproduction steps:
Jump on Mr ice block, grab, and abort level while grabbing. Segfaults

As explained in the issue, the player is destroyed before the grab listener. I believe it segfaults here:
https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/1df160fa556f6f1875b869562bb579c3bab8163b/src/supertux/game_object.cpp#L54-L56
when the grab listener (associated with the now-destroyed player) does something.

By ungrabbing in the player destructor, we also remove this listener and avoid this issue. Let me know if this seems correct, thanks

An out-of-bounds read in the texture manager causes supertux to segfault on
startup on OpenBSD with SDL >=2.0.10. This happens when processing the
bottom-right tile of images/tiles/doodads/tux-statue.png.

Source surface has insufficient pixels data for the tile destination
surface we are blitting to. tux-statue.png has 93 rows, but the bottom
right tile at (32, 64) would try to blit a 32x32 tile's worth of pixel
data. However, tux-statue.png only extends from row 64 to 93.

To resolve this truncate rectangles at the bottom tiles. Use
SDL_CreateRGBSurface + SDL_BlitSurface instead of
SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceFrom.

User experience:

- [x] No audio
  - [x] Now the audio is there, but whenever a sound stop playing, OpenAL crashes (see [this issue](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/13797))
- [x] Extreme lag
- [x] Refreshing makes the game twice as laggy (probably in link with the memory leaks)
- [x] No data is saved when closing the tab/browser or when refreshing
- [x] Add-ons are disabled, but appear as they can't download anything. (If I could compile cURL with OpenSSL for Emscripten...)

Code quality:
- [x] Very poor-quality changes
  - [x] Fix the comments in the CMakeLists.txt file
  - [x] Find a way to not have to put the OpenAL headers from Emscripten in the repo (locate then in the Emscripted SDK)
  - [x] Repair that poor ScreenManager who's probably agonizing at the moment
- [x] Memory leaks in the main function
- [x] Poor memory lifetime management
- [x] HTML template is the default Emscripten template

## Potential additions

- [x] Content integration
- [x] Hide the ""Quit"" button, which doesn't make much sense on the browser (will also be useful for mobile ports)
- [x] A method to save levels to disk and load levels from disk
- [x] A method to save preferences, progress, possibly saved levels and others in the user's browser (localStorage) <sub>Not cookies please, they have a size limit and they're sent with each request, nor very good for efficiency, privacy and speed</sub>
- [x] A warning before the game launches to tell the users that the web version is laggy and unstable and doesn't save data reliably, and to prefer using the native version instead"

Now any sprite can support up/down/left/right animations, it they don't exist it fallbacks to the generic directionless animation, if it doesn't exist either it fallbacks to not changing the animation."
586190334,Added scripting to rotating spotlight object + some changes,Semphriss,2021-03-07 05:18:40+00:00,2021-04-27 13:35:53+00:00,{'involves:scripting': 1},"Fixes #768 

Added setters, faders, and easers for angle, rotation speed, and light color.

Also changed the direction variable to consider not rotating at all.

Also changed GameObjects to handle FadeHelpers globally. This will require a refactor of all GameObject-inheriting classes to call GameObject::update(float) where necessary.

Consideration: Although the ""direction"" property seems needless (as clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation can be achieved using positive or negative values), I chose to leave it there so that scripters can easily change the direction of a spotlight - or stop it completely - without having to know/remember its original speed in some way if they want to reset it at a later point."

The new fonts contain glyphs of both English/Latin and Hebrew or Devanagari, and they do not make the game crash.
*GitHub displays the fonts as empty files, but they are not (this is a GitHub front-end bug); Please clone the fork and review it by the local cloned repository. The changes should be OK if there is no missing important glyph (of English and Hebrew or Devanagari), and the game does not crash during using Hebrew or Devanagari; I didn't experience any problem while testing, but you are the reviewers.

Now, limits are applies regardless of what the player presses, and the speed is brought back within limits smoothly rather than instantly.
- Added a boost mechanism, to help Tux gain extra velocity above speed limits for a short amount of time (useful for bumpers).
- Fixed the one-wall walljump-climbing bug."

List of changes:

- Improved text selection: pressing left or right while having text selected will move the caret to the beginning or the end of the text selection, respectively (and clear the selection)
- Refactored the handling of the backspace key to make it similar to the handling of the delete key. This allows the usage of the regular update() function and makes controls compatible with Widgets again, in addition to make the code generally cleaner.

- Coins stuck in solid matter will no longer request to play a sound every single frame.
- A sound failing to pause will no longer throw the error back to the main game loop, resulting in an unexpected crash. It will rather be handled on the spot, just like playing, stopping or resuming.
- Oppositely, a sound that fails to be created will no longer silently catch the error and continue the execution normally, but instead will force the caller to handle the error and, as one can logically assume, will not store the audio for further manipulations.

If you have a portion of you level that is bigger or smaller, you can now use zooming to increase the effect on the player :)

Accessible from `Camera.set_scale(scale)`, `Camera.scale(scale, time)` and `Camera.ease_scale(scale, time, easing)` where:
- **scale** is a decimal number which is the zoom multiplier. 1 is default zoom, The gif uses 0.75. A smaller number = a larger portion of the level visible to the screen.
- **time** is a decimal number that represent the time it will take to reach the scale.
- **easing** is a string with the name of the easing you want to use, following the format ""Ease`[Mode][Direction]`"" where ""Mode"" is the easing mode (Sine, Exponential, Back, Bounce, etc.) and Direction is In, Out, or InOut. For a ful llist of possibilites, see: https://easings.net/ (note that the name are not exactly the name, the order is different). Examples: ""EaseSineInOut"", ""EaseBounceOut"", ""EaseBackIn"""
506930299,Allow sprite animations to continue each other,Semphriss,2020-10-20 16:08:00+00:00,2020-10-21 21:02:11+00:00,{},"Fixes #1462 

Added family-name property to sprites.

Family names are a way for the game to identify sprites that continue each other; when switching between actions with the same family name, animations won't reset.

------

### Technical details

Add an optional property called ""family-name"" for all sprite actions. For a given sprite, switching between actions with the same family name will remember ""progress"" in the animation. This will prevent resetting the animation, for example, when flipped.

If the property is absent, the game will assign family names automatically based on links created by the mirror_action and clone_action properties. That means if you have an action, plus another action which is a mirror of the first one, plus another which is a clone of either the first or the second, they will all share the same family name.

Result:
- Two actions with the same family name will make both actions continue (aka not reset) when switching from one to another directly.
- Two actions with different family names or without family names will make animations reset when switching form one to another.
- A mirrored or cloned action without a family name that links to an action without a family name will make the game create a random family name and assign the same to both. (as if they both had the same family name)
- A mirrored or cloned action without a family name that links to an action with a family name will make the mirrored action inherit its linked action's family name. (the mirrored/cloned action will have the same family name as its parent)
- A mirrored or cloned action with a family name that links to an action without a family name will make both actions have different family names, and therefore will cancel the effect of this proposal."
505565435,Editor autosave,Semphriss,2020-10-18 21:28:39+00:00,2020-11-06 21:05:32+00:00,{},"Closes #1551 

The new autosave feature will automaticaly save the current level to a backup file (**not** the level file, but a different one) each time the level is tested or at most 5 minutes after the level was last saved/auto-saved (amount of time customizable through the editor pause menu).

If the editor crashes, the recovery file will survive and will be detected by the editor on next launch. Level editors will have the option to open the recovery file or not.
- If they choose to open the recovery file, they must save the file manually to apply the recovery data to the main save file. Not saving before quitting the editor will discard the recovery data permanently.
- If they choose to *not* open the recovery file, the regular file will be opened instead and progress will be where it was at the last *manual* save (Ctrl+S, or through the menu). Although from this point onwards, the recovery file is already assumed to be gone, it will not actually be deleted/overwritten unless the user takes one of the actions listed below.

**The recovery file is deleted when:**
1. _The user saves the level manually._
The recovery file is deleted until a new autosave request is initiated by the game. The reason is that manually saving makes the regular file more recent than the recovery file; the auto-save would then be useless, as it is older than the actual save.

2. _The user quits the editor._
Quitting the editor is considered a normal operation. The user is assumed to be aware of the state of the save file upon quitting the editor (they will be told if their level has unsaved changes and asked to confirm their choice). The recovery file is then needless (no need to offer a user to recover unsaved changes if they explicitly chose to discard them).

# Info for the users

To create custom particles :
1. In the level editor, go in Objects -> Sector
2. Notice two very similar icons : A yellow sparkle, and another yellow sparkle with a small file icon.
   - The one without the file icon is if you want to create your custom particles the traditional way. Be careful, it can get messy!
   - The one with a file is if you want to use the particle editor. Read below for instructions about the particle editor :)
3. Add one of the object you chose to the sector
4. Right-click the icon that just appeared, and give your particle system a name. Keep it in note, you'll need it later :)
5. If you want, change some settings. If you want to see them immediately, make sure the ""Cover screen"" option is checked, then test your level. Beware, that means your particles will spawn everywhere on your screen - if that's not what you want, keep reading!
6. Go in Objects -> Environment
7. Towards the bottom, you should see a light green box, with a barely visible yellow sparkle that looks like the one for the particle system; that's the particle zone object.
8. Add a particle zone object, place it and resize it at your taste, then right-click on it:
   - Set the ""Particle Name"" (**not** ""Name"", really ""Particle Name"") property to the name you gave your particles a bit earlier. A particle zone will only affect particles that correspond to its particle type. All other particles (either non-custom particles, or custom particles with a different name) will be unaffected.
   - Set the zone type to whatever you want it to be. The possibilities are :
      - Spawn zone (default) : Particles of the type you specified will spawn in this zone. You can have multiple spawn zones for the same particle object. Make sure the ""Cover screen"" option is **not** checked, else your spawn zones will be ignored :)
      - Living zones : Particles are allowed to spawn in or enter this area, but if they leave it, they'll enter their dying phase. (That is, if you set the death effect to be a fade out, the particle will start fading out immediately as it leaves the zone)
      - Living zones with clear on exit : Same as above, but if particles leave it, they are instantly destroyed. This can be useful if particles leaving the zone cannot be seen on the screen - this will avoid having to calculate the movement for a particle that doesn't matter anyways :)
      - Kill zone : If a particle enters this zone, it'll start its dying phase.
     - Clear zone : If a particle enters this zone, it'll be immediately cleared.
9. Repeat step 8 as many times as you want.
10. Save and test your level. You should see your particles :)

# Info on the development

## What has been done

#### Oct 13, 2020
- The custom particles object is fully customizable both using the classic interface and through the particle editor
- The particle editor is accessible from the options menu of custom particles
- The zones are all ready and fully-functional; they also display their corresponding particle's name, and their color change based on their type

## What remains to do
- [x] **Get user feedback!**
- [x] Add options for multiple textures for a single particle object (the game will pick one of the textures at random - let the user select the likeliness for each texture)
- [ ] Expose the particles to scripting
- [x] Improve the code quality, and fix all the TODO's and FIXME's
- [x] Create some decent showcases - perhaps some people can help me with that?"

The snow background tileset is the first to be implemented with this system, as the tiles are designed to imply solidity on the corners rather than on the tile's center, like traditional snow would.

This results in a much smoother and intuitive experience, as well as more precise tile configurations.

*I also took the freedom to add two tiles so that the tileset fit that system better.*

**This does not replace the old system!** It's an addition that makes sense with how certain tilesets are made. If I have some time, the worldmap tileset should also be converted to this system.

A badguy that's fun to beat should have a well-defined, easy-to-understand pattern so that new players that aren't well used to the game dont get surprised by a sudden, unexpected change of movement from a badguy.

It also helps speedrunners by not throwing a whole run simply because mister pilot decided it'd hover at the worst height possible and stay there on the best run of the day.

**Currently:**
Pilots accelerate randomly. Each time you load a level, the pilot's pattern will be different.

**At the moment, this PR makes it so that:**
Pilot have a deterministic, but hard-to-predict pattern. That is, playing the same level and going at the same pace should result in similar encounters with the badguys. This solves the speedrunners' problems, but does not yet solve the predictability problem.

**To-do:**
- [x] Make the pilot/flying snowball follow a simple, clearly-defined movement. It could be a simple sine wave movement, or something a bit more complex like this : https://www.desmos.com/calculator/aw4dpgqntf (if link dies, the formula is `sin(x)^3 + sin(3 * (x - pi/3))/3`)
- [x] Investigate and remove randomness from the skullyhops, I've been told they have random movements too.

# <a name=""info-for-level-designers""></a>Info for level designers

If your levels contain cutscenes, you can say goodbye to watching them every time you test your levels - now you can make them skippable by using these to simple functions!

### How can my level support skippable cutscenes?

In your Squirrel scripts, simply add `start_cutscene()` at the beginning of your cutscene, and at the end, add `end_cutscene()`. Simple as that! Now, you can skip your cutscene simply by hitting the escape button on your keyboard :)

### Will this break my level?

It shouldn't - all the code that happens in your script will be executed, and it will all happen in order - it just will do everything instantly instead of waiting :)

Still, it is always a good idea to try to skip cutscenes to make sure your level doesn't break. If you encounter a problem, let me know! :)

### Good practices with cutscenes

There are certain types of cutscenes that shouldn't be made skippable. For example, cutscenes where the amount of time elapsed is critically important (for example, a door closing very slowly and relying on the fact that Tux can't move while it closes) shouldn't be made skippable to avoid letting the player pass under the door if the skip the cutscene and run fast enough. It is however a good idea to keep these cutscenes as short as possible.

**Very recommended :** At the end of each cutscene, try to ""reset"" time-based actions as much as possible. For example, if you use smooth fade-ins or fade-outs, add a final fade-in of 0 seconds to make sure the level is visible and clear once the cutscene is over. If your cutscene ends with, say, a final fade-in of 2 seconds, you space the final fade-in and the ""reset calls"" with `wait(2)`. Make sure that `end_cutscene()` is called with those reset calls. (Before or after, doesn't matter)

Example :
```squirrel

start_cutscene();

Tux.deactivate();
Effect.fade_out(1.0);

wait(3.0);

Effect.fade_in(1.0);

wait(1.0);

Tux.activate();

// Without cutscenes, this line wouldn't be needed.
// It's just there so it won't fade in slowly after you skipped the cutscene.
Effect.fade_in(0.0);

end_cutscene();
```

Or :
```squirrel
Tux.deactivate();
Effect.fade_out(1.0);

// It doesn't matter if this line is before or after the first calls,
// as long as it's called before the first ""wait()""
start_cutscene();

wait(3.0);

Effect.fade_in(1.0);

wait(1.0);

// It doesn't matter if this line is before or after the reset calls,
// as long as it's called after the last ""wait()""
end_cutscene();

Tux.activate();
Effect.fade_in(0.0);
```

# <a name=""info-for-programmers""></a>Info for programmers

### How it works

(Requires understanding the [info for level designers](#info-for-level-designers))

TL;DR It basically cancels all calls to `wait(float)` between `start_cutscene()` and `end_cutscene()`.

Details :
- When `start_cutscene()` is called, it stores a variable in the Level object to remember that a cutscene started. (The variable is in the level, so that if an unskilled level designer calls `start_cutscene()`but never calls `end_cutscene()`, the erronous state won't spread to other levels.)
- When the player hits escape, instead of immediately popping the pause menu, it checks if there is a cutscene running. If yes, then it stores another variable in the Level object to remember that the user wishes to skip the currently running cutscene, and it does not show the menu. After this second variable is set, further escape keys will effectively show the pause menu, so that if, for any reason, the cutscene refuses to finish (see example above about unskilled LDs), the player won't be kept from opening the menu and effectively stuck inside the level.
- When that second variable is set, the Squirrel scheduler will immediately resume (""wake up"") all suspended VMs (running threads) and swap subsequent calls to `wait(float)`with `wait(0)`. The call to `wait` is not completely ignored in case some scripts are coded like `while (true) {wait(0.5), ...}`, so that they won't freeze the game. **Note :** Only calls to `wait` that were executed after `start_cutscene()` (and before `end_cutscene()`) will be skipped. That is, if there is another script using waits but not cutscene functions, they will not be fast-forwarded.
- When `end_cutscene()` is called, either after skipping the cutscene or displaying it normally, both variables are reset and all calls to `wait(float)` will work as expected.

### Backwards compatibility

The addition is effectless on current levels. To use the system of skippable cutscenes, a level _must_ make use of `start_cutscene()` and `end_cutscene()`.

I tried to make the integration as seamless and simple as possible, so it won't for example, skip some important code. Still, it is good to always test each cutscene to make sure there aren't any bugs, visual artifacts, or other unwanted side effects.

Such side effects will most likely take the form of effects taking time to finish after the cutscene was skipped. For example :
```squirrel
start_cutscene();
Effect.fade_out(1);
wait(2);
Effect.fade_in(1);
end_cutscene();
```

When skipping, notice how the `fade_in` is still running. This happens because `fade_in` is non-blocking and still executed after the cutscene is over.

The ""skip-the-cutscene"" case scenario cancels calls to `wait`, so the code will be executed like this :
```squirrel
start_cutscene();
Effect.fade_out(1);
Effect.fade_in(1);
end_cutscene();
```

Notice how `fade_in` and `end_cutscene` are called at the same time. `fade_in` will still do something after `end_cutscene` has been called.

This :
```squirrel
start_cutscene();
Effect.fade_out(1);
wait(2);
Effect.fade_in(1);
wait(1)
end_cutscene();
```

...won't work either, as `wait`is ignored when skipping a cutscene.

The solution is this :
```squirrel
start_cutscene();
Effect.fade_out(1);
wait(2);
Effect.fade_in(1);
wait(1)
Effect.fade_in(0);
end_cutscene();
```

One final call to `fade_in` with a time of 0. This will make sure that once the cutscene is finished, all effects are in the state they are expected to be.

The ""skip-the-cutscene"" case scenario will execute it like this :
```squirrel
start_cutscene();
Effect.fade_out(1);
Effect.fade_in(1);
Effect.fade_in(0);
end_cutscene();
```

`Effect.fade_in(0);` will be effective immediately, correcting the problem.

### Bug prevention

I made the system as resilient as I could against poor level designers. Wrongful calls (`start_cutscene()` twice in a row, `start_cutscene()` not paired with a corresponding `end_cutscene()`, orphaned `end_cutscene()` (without a `start_cutscene()`), etc.) will **not** result in undefined behavior, but will rather display a warning in the console and attempt to recover safely. Plus, the variables are stored inside the Level object, so that errors arising from a given level won't spread across the game or affect another level.

Tux can always use them, he doesn't have to line up with them.  Also, they do not move.  They don't have collision with other objects at the moment.  They also cannot be picked up.

Due to how different they behave to normal trampolines, they are classified as different objects, but they still use similar sprites.

- Added new bumpy snow tiles everywhere relevant, as well as bumpy ceiling snow tiles.
- Fixed the ugly spikes and replaced them with more sophisticated spikes that are 7/8ths of a tile higher than they should, giving them a distinguished view from the ground, also making the snow cover them instead of being behind them, as well as being behind tux.
- Improvements to ""Welcome to Antarctica"" where I added a pit, so the player knows what they are by indicating a ""!"" sign telling them it is bad, also changed the coins where the sign is slightly, also added a slope earlier in the level to introduce the fact that slopes exist (they weren't anywhere in levels until ""A Fork in the Road"" which is kind of silly). I also made the Power-Up not progressive as of someone else's suggestion, and I personally agree with the sentiment.
- Removed the impossible coins in ""Entrance to the Cave""

- The terrain is more natural (Above the Arctic Skies had some rather blocky areas, particularly where the secret was).
- The terrain now has better height variation, and distinguishable features and sections of different types of platforms and solids (unisolids and normal solids).
- The level is less cluttered with badguys, less badguy dense, which is beneficial for a level where the main Power-Up is an air flower, something that is actually quite finicky to use, you move more so the player needs more time to react to enemies, and so more spread out badguys is better.
- The Platform sections are more clear and also require player interaction to make work (Button).
- The level features better secrets that both require the use of the air flower, making the air flower a required Power-Up to get the secret. An example of this can be found in ""Ice in the Hole"" where the fire flower is needed to access a secret, so I think this adds more flavour and variety to the stage.
- The level has more collectables that are spread out in a more fun way, making a collect-a-thon more enjoyable.
- There are less awkward jumps and platforms in my level than the old one, and the platforms have more distinct 'boarding/docking stations'.

I sent this level to Rusty a while ago. I took his feedback and put it into this stage, which I think at this point is pretty much as good as it's going to get.

Yes, they do follow the same behavior as flames, moving around in a circle.  You can set the radius and speed of their movement as well as a delay for when they begin moving.  You can also change the sprite.

They could possibly be introduced in the ice bridge levels in Icy Island because 1) Those levels introduce no new mechanics and 2) They could ""foreshadow"" the introduction of the flames by introducing a docile/helpful variant and then showing you the enemy version of it.

- ""You can't Climb Higher than the Clouds"" fixed unrealistic level target time.
- Enemy fixes in ""Another Cold Day"" stopping enemies from killing themselves.
- Lantern position fixed in ""Cold Cavern"" as well as 1 bad enemy placement at the end.
- Fixed unrealistic Target times for ""Crystal Sunset"", "" Crystal Fields"", ""The Dark Castle"" and the other ""The Dark Castle"", ""Deep, deeper..."", ""...deepest!"", ""Circles"", ""Entering the castle"", ""After the Glaciers"", ""Snowfall alert"", ""My Penny is over the ocean"", ""To rain or not to rain...""

- Fixed the snowball that killed itself via enemy cramming in ""Out on the Crystal Fields""
- Sleeping spiky replaced with igel due to the spiky being woken up by spawning in anyway, and it just falls off and kills itself... Also removed a fireball which killed you within a second of spawning in the level ""The Dark Castle"" (Forest variant) which is just unfair.
- Added light fade in scripts to ""The Dark Castle"" (Antarctic variant) because the old scripts were sudden, and were very sore. Also fixed a visual inconsistency.
- Added a target time for ""Circles"" and also moved the Power-Up due to it blocking the way forcing the player to swap power-ups.
- ""Don't Miss your ride"" Adjusted the end to make it less annoying to get to the secret using the spring.
- ""Going Down"" Stopped enemies from killing themselves inside their chambers, also fixed the coins during the descent as some were extremely difficult to get all in one go (you need to collect all coins in one go to get the perfect coin objective).
- ""Entering the castle"" fixed a basic visual bug with the spikes underwater.
- Fixed the scripts in ""Flower Bonus"".
- ""After the Glaciers"" Fixed the rotation and position of sleeping spikys,  due to the jump over it being very tough and killing the spiky without taking damage having a small window of timing.
- Fixed the secret requiring a damage boost in ""In the Spring"".
- Fixed the awkward secret in ""Some light in the darkness would be fine, Thanks!"" (inconsistency with the green spikes, the top could be stood on but the sides were dangerous).
- Visual inconsistencies in ""Snowfall alert"" have been fixed with the spikes.
- Removed the spikes at the bottom of ""Holes, a day on Ice"" due to enemies dying off-screen and making a lot of noise throughout the entire level, making it very annoying and painful to play.
- Fixed impossible secret and soft-locking platforms in the second sector of ""The Toilette zone"". Also removed the secret that also acted as a shortcut due to it hindering perfect completion.. not making it impossible but just a lot more annoying.
- ""My Penny is over the ocean"" snowball enemy replaced with pink snow.
- Removed the zeekling, wisp, some coins, and reworking the platform node to be less obnoxious in ""Red Alert! The forest is burning!"" Also removed a couple springs in the secret to allow all coins to be easily collected instead of doing awkward duck jumps.
- Made the roof in ""Sewer escape"" just a bit higher since coyote time was removed, so the jumps from those ledges are very hard and very punishing.
- Made some changes to how you get on the secret elevator in ""Three Frosty Icebergs"" due to tux being crushed in rare occasions. Also edited a visual bug at the goal.

- Removed a jumpy in ""...Where Everything Is Possible"" where you had to abuse a weird mechanic which involved throwing a fireball at the moment tux reverses his velocity causing a fireball to have a different, skewed trajectory... it's a mouthful but basically the enemy was very hard to kill, and given there are no ice cubes in the stage it needed to be removed, jumping down to its platform would cause a soft-lock."

*Sorry for my bad english*
Hi, my name is André Pinheiro, I live in Portugal and I want to present my idea to you.
My ideia is **change** the **boat** for **swimming tux** in worldmap, the question is... 
> Why change the boat sprite for swimming Tux?

## My arguments

Well, I my opinion, the boat sprite is too old and for me, it does make sense in the game. In fact, the swimming tux is the best option because with the new swimming feature added to the game, it would make more sense to have the swimming tux on the worldmap instead of a boat. I also think the boat sprite is weak on quality issues, have you noticed that?

## The sprite

Well, I tried make it similar to the existing worldmap sprites in the game and the moviment of swimmig tux, here you have two gifs to take your conclusions...

However, the fire still goes diagonally down while fading (into the ground), which looks awkward. But at least it fades.

The problem was in `LiveFire::active_update` line 63-66, if state was still `STATE_WALKING`, the sprite action would be set to regular walking (not fading) just after hitting the bomb. Since collision group is set to `COLGROUP_DISABLED`, it also would not interact with objects anymore. So an extra state is added `STATE_DEAD` to avoid this."

Please check also my code for the torch - certain parts were drawn on `LAYER_TILES - 1`, which I changed to `m_layer - 1`. `LAYER_TILES` is defined to 0 in video/layer.hpp, so with the default value of 0 for `m_layer`, existing behaviour should be unaffected.

“Perfect” stats: All badguys killed / all coins collected / all secrets found / target time beaten.

This affects the following:
* Level intro screen
* Level outro screen
* Level stats in worldmap

The record time will become green if it is lower than the target time. If the level does not have a target time, it turns green when the level was beaten.

Examples:

* If you got 100/100 coins, the coins text will be green. If you got fewer coins, the text will be the default color.
* If you beat the level in 30 seconds, and there is a target time of 1 min, time text is green.
* If you beat the level in 4 hours, and there is no target time, time text is still green.

With this you can see which parts of the level you did perfectly at a glance. You don't need to read anymore, as soon you see green, you know it's perfect. Basically it's a small quality-of-life improvement."

The level icon will also be animated. It's like the green dot, but it flashes briefly. This animation is very subtle and is hard/annoying to tell apart from normal levels. You have to way a few seconds to see which levels are perfect. IMO the visual distinction is way too subtle, which always bothered me.

This PR changes the icon of perfect levels to a star, so that the visual distinction is much more obvious. Screenshot:

The star is based on the star powerup icon.

This PR also changes the icon of the “shroom” style (forest stye, `shroom.sprite`). Currently, the icons are:

* incomplete: Mushroom
* complete: red stars, not animated
* perfect: red stars, animated

Basically, when swimming there is a hidden (not graphically represented) vector pointing at current acceleration direction. Arrow keys fluently change this direction (i.e. acceleration can be at any angle, but it's going torwards 1 of 8, that is currently pointed) and apply small force. One time boost in currently pointed direction can be achived by using jump key. Besides that there is weak gravity and dynamic friction (simple models)."

I have changed the forest dirt textures, please tell me what you think.
Btw: As far as I know, in a real spruce forest (in Germany), there are needles on the top, under the needles there is a fluffy dark-brown layer, and further down there is yellow or grey loam.

It enables fixed-size ambient sounds to work and play. Revamped the distance calculation to be accurate.
Current issues:
- Only one sound will play.
- The first global ambient sound encountered (without a fixed size) will always be the one that plays.
- If there's no global ambient sound, the first one listed in the .stl file will be the only one that will play, but only if within the range of the ambient sound.
- Copied from ambient_sound.cpp:
/* notes:
  Only one ambient sound per frame will be played.
  How can this be fixed? 
  - Maybe have a pool of the ambientsounds to play
    (allocated with max = #sounds per level), aind then
    play all per frame within the size?
  - Don't use more than 1 global ambient sound? 
    - But his will still cancel out the fixed size ones.

Uses polygons for collision detection against tilemap. Inorder to mitigate the problem of ""hidden edges"", polygons flag adjacent vertices and ignore such normals during collision resolution. Uses SAT (seperating axes theorem) for collision detection between the polygons.

- [x] Moving solid tilemaps
- [ ] inline Documentation
- [ ] Wiki/Latex pdf generated documentation 
- [ ]  some changes to blocks => general review of collision handling in src/object/

Adds curved flight path. 

The new flight path is a parabola f(x) = ax^2+bx+c.
The coefficients are calculated by solving a 3x3 linear system of equations using the gauss algorithm.

This probably changes the difficulty of many levels, so please test e.g. with Down the Rabbit Hole. 
Difficulty can be adjusted by changing the interval of player distance in which the zeekling will start flying down.

Possible issue: 
    -  No position lower than the expected Tux position is hit. (Maybe fix by changing the function).
    -  When going up again (gaining height) the curve is ignored and the zeekling moves linear.

**Potential Problems / Discussion Topics**

- ~~No caching of images, if they add-ons do not provide a `url-local` field. **Make this obligatory?**~~ Images are cached if an addon with same md5-hash is installed or in the repository. Cache is cleaned up after every use of the addon-manager.
- Adds dynamically heigth menu items (for the images), this leads to O(n) computation of selected menu item instead of O(1), because of the small size of menu items this seems to be ok.

**Testing**
Please test using `--repository-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christ2go/addons/master/index-0_5.nfo`. The only worldmap with images is Lolkats-Levels, eventhough the images are from RustyBoxs Crystal Mine. Note, that supertux remembers the repository-url even if you leave the command line argument out.

ICESTATE_WAKING state, the sprite action is set to ""waking-left"" or
""waking-right"", depending on the direction of MrIceBlock. After the animation is
finished, we go to the ICESTATE_NORMAL state.

This might still need some tweaking with regards to the attributes of the waking
state (should it still be possible to kick it? will it hurt the player?) and
the animation loop.

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that this will break custom sprites that do
not have animations for ""waking-left"" and/or ""waking-right"" defined. If that is
the case, sprite->animation_done() will always return false, causing the
MrIceBlock object to stay in the ICESTATE_WAKING state forever. Graphics have
been added and animations defined for the standard ice block as well as its pink
version. Those graphics were contributed by BlasterMaster.

Now the functions store and load allow scripts to easily preserve data.
Syntax: store(varname,value), where varname is a string, and value is a
serializable object. A squirrel object is serializible iff it is of type
Array, Table, String, Int, Bool, Float. Arrays and Tables are also serializable,
iff they only contain serializible items (eg. Array of Array of Int is serializable).
To load an object the function load(varname) is provided.

Serialization
Is currently done in the form of S-Expressions.  The file is in the same
directory as the savegame file and has the extension .sss

Implementation
When a object is stored it is tranformed into a internal data structure
representing arrays (sqarray in sqarrayser.cpp) , tables (sqdict in sqdictser.cpp)
 and scalar values (stored using boost::any container). The dictionary class
provides a general storage of names and the associated item in the internal
data structure. When a worldmap is loaded a new dictionary is created,
when a worldmap is left a dictionary is destroyed, and the file is created.

The internal data structures for arrays and tables  are implemented as classes,
which all provide the following methods
- load(ReaderCollection& r)
  
  Used for loading from the file
- get(HSQUIRRELVM v)
  
  Used for pushing onto the stack
- serialize(Writer\* serialize)
  
  Used for serializing the object
- loadArray(HSQUIRRELVM v) (or loadDict)
  
  Used for loading from squirrel

Issues / Further Modifications

-Currently only basic types are storable. Extend it to ""special"" C++
 Classes which e.g. implement an Interface Storable or use an auto-
 matically generated wrapper for serializing some classes.

-Add option to store from the game and make such stored items ""private"".

Quoting @tobbi:

> I did try it with the level ""shaft racing"" from Yeti's Revenge add-on. Once you kick the ice block into the wooden blocks on the right, it always crashes with the above assertion.

The problem is that _TileMap::get_tiles_overlapping_ returns a deformed rectangle (one whose top > bottom or left > right) when a tilemap is out of view. My code relies on the draw rectangle being valid. It didn't cause crashes previously, because the original 2 nested for loops ruled out these deformities. I've added a check, which should have been there before.

Anyway, in this particular case, the assertion failed when the cart (which is a tilemap with a defined path) got out of view.

56265609,Fix a case of grown Tux having smaller height than he appears,MiroslavR,2016-01-16 23:16:42+00:00,2016-01-17 10:39:37+00:00,{},"If you place Tux inside a wall (e.g. via ghost mode) while he is 'grown', he gets hit but retains his 'grown' state (not 100% reproducible, sometimes he just dies immediately), while his height (the value) is lowered to that of small/'nobonus' Tux. This results in behavior seen in #303.

I've found that in this case adjust_height() is called twice for some reason:
- in kill(), before calling set_state(): https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/c3edde698049d00dad851e62ae67b7108d0976fd/src/object/player.cpp#L1534
- in set_state(): https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/c3edde698049d00dad851e62ae67b7108d0976fd/src/object/player.cpp#L1138

The first call is superfluous, because set_state() already performs height adjustment via adjust_height(). Now, if adjust_height() finds out that Tux's height would increase AND the new height would cause Tux to be stuck inside a wall, it fails (returns false) without changing his height. If adjust_height() fails in set_state(), Tux's state won't be changed, either.

What happens is that kill() sets Tux's height from big to small, and then set_state() attempts to set Tux's height from small to small. This does not seem like a problem. However, due to float precision issues (arising from RectF not being defined by its height -- the height needs to be calculated), the second call of adjust_height() thinks that Tux's height is to be increased (in my case from 30.7999878 to 30.8), therefore performs stuck check and fails (because obviously I'm in a wall). Therefore, Tux remains in 'grown' state, but his height is small.

I'm not sure whether or how this is related to #303, but there is a possibility this PR could fix it. Also, this PR removes some code that is never executed.

  When you create a directiry `./supertux2/levels/<levelset directory>`, it works.
- [x] Application might fall when editing properties of some objects.
  It happens only with the newly put objects or objects in addon-levels. Does never happen with some object classes.
- [x] Launch a level, exit it and then launch a level the editor. When you do that, game crashes, because it can't load the player.
- [x] Application falls when exiting the level that is being tested.
- [x] Application falls when the level is tested the secound time.
- [ ] The resizers don't despawn when the area object is deleted. (not critical)
- [x] Game lags the computer when an object with path is deleted.
- [x] Right click don't work, ctrl+left clicks are used instead. see: #312 
- [x] Sometimes when testing the level, the editor stuff displays in the game session and then the game crashes after exiting the level.
- [x] Sometimes a white overlay displays all over the screen and stays until game exit. Doesn't happen on all machines.

19840017,Optional glbinding as OpenGL binding,scheibel,2014-08-15 11:32:35+00:00,2014-08-22 20:49:21+00:00,{},"This week my team published an alternative OpenGL binding beside GLEW.
As a simple test we tried to replace the OpenGL binding of known open-source software with ours: glbinding.

For SuperTux this was a pleasingly simple task.
I just want you to be able to use our work we have done while integrating glbinding.
If you pull this PR into your branch, the build defaults to the exact same setting as without this PR.

That has been done:
- add glbinding as optional dependency
- add an option that glbinding can be used instead of GLEW
- add another option to enable per OpenGL-function tracing during runtime
- adapt OpenGL-dependent code so that it works with both GLEW and glbinding

I know this is just a mirror, but if you're interested in the code you can merge this PR in your internally used git-Repository.
