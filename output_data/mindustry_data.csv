2866660369,Reactivity and Assorted Changes,SomeonesShade,2025-09-27 16:12:31+00:00,,{},"##### Serpulo Balancing: Unit-Turret w/ Reactivity
##### _Updated: September 28, 2025_

## Summary of Changes

- Implemented Activation Time, which is when Turrets need some time before they activate.
  - This includes sprite changes similar to heat for turrets, a setBars(), and a setStats() to be extra clear and make players... not confused.
- Implemented Deposit Cooldowns on a per turret basis (similar to itemDepositCooldown).
  -  i.e. fuses may inflict a 1 second cooldown, while salvos being 2.0 seconds.
- Also fixed turret overdrive boost and coolants getting chopped off from Math.min(), making multiplicative boosts not fall short. 

## Rationale

- To be detailed further in a dedicated Suggestion Post (I'll do it when I'm available again kek, although it isn't necessary)
- The general summary is that turrets main disadvantage is the **upfront cost** the defender has to foot in, in exchange for great ammo cost to killed unit cost _(otherwise you would be using units for defense)_. Reactive mechanics essentially **bypasses** the upfront cost; this is notorious for lancer/arc, or shockmines against Ground T1-T3.
- Problematic mechanics that can't be maanged with stat balancing... i.e. no wiring power turrets and item filling... needs to be managed. 
- This is the purpose of this pr, to allow future balance to be possible under the new stat framework given.
-  ...I wouldn't be able to get the numbers right the first time.
- For the reload fix, it's to make the balancing more predictable, and players actually getting the advertised multiplied boost rate.

## Caveats and Disclaimers
- Activation Time will brick your savefiles _if you downgrade_, according to Anuke this is fine but something to keep in mind when working with different beta versions/forks...
- Due to how the inheritance works, Parallax/Segment does not have Activation Time as a stat... _(see needed feedback)._ 
- Deposit Cooldown is set as opt in for pvp servers to utilize... I wanted to make the setStats() update depending on the current rule set... but I'm unable to so its hidden by default _(see needed feedback)_.
- The turret reload fix may need a future counterbalance pr/sp as it does cause an ugly phase where units are a bit weaker due to this. Can be done post-merge though.
- A shockmines fix hasn't been done yet, since there is a stat based solution for it, I'm thinking of (spikeweed shockmines or iirc see Blackberry's mega pr)... but I'm on hiatus so this is not something I'm prioritizing for this pr.

## Needed Feedback
Stuff I need to answer or ask... I may answer these on my own, but these reflect the current thoughts I have on my mind regarding this pr...

#### Activation Time
**[Status: Ready to Merge]**
- Activation Time is applicable to non-power turrets as well... I wonder if it's okay for those types since this can be applied to mods or future turret balancing.
- Are the sprites good (shape, color, and execution)? Its more placeholdery with how I did it... 
- default is currently Color.white and the sprites reflect it... should be fine?
- Parallax can have the feature as well, but... if it isn't here, better done alongside a balance change to parallax on a different pr?
- Value Adjustment: the current values aren't fine-tuned, but more of a PoC value set. This can be adjusted in tandem with other stat changes for any future pr...

#### Deposit Cooldown
**[Status: Main Mechanics done... Completion and Polishing remains]**
- This is the only one that could potentially be removed if there is a better approach
- Should this be opt in and not opt out? (The change doesn't make sense in campaign so yeah)
- I know that the feature could be better communicated as it doesn't have a setStats() entry, its tricky if this needs to be made clear.
- Should the gamerule be visible in the rules dialog area? (I would probably put it beside the core deposit rule set)
- **[Currently and actively being decided, may or may not be commited after posting the pr]** Should it really be added to the base item deposit cooldown? May cause issues to the non-sever side values of deposit cooldown via the server-side deposit cooldown.
- Long name for the gamerule... hmm...
- Value Adjustment: the current values aren't fine-tuned, but more of a PoC value set. May or may not be too significant.

#### Reload Fix
**[Status: Determining what to do next]**
- Well... I feel like the code can be done better? (2 variables seems hmm, but eh). Not sure how...
- Major concern is that this buffs turrets... may need a mininum nerf to have the previous boost rates the same as before by nerfing the base turret? 
- Or... buffing the hp for T4+?

## Proof of Function

Footage of Reactivity (from jehosula)
Defenses are placed reactively and not preemptively. This can be problematic as the turret and unit dyanmics of upfront cost is no longer at play.

## Post Dev Notes

> Finally finished this feature (activation time), the epiphany when I saw the heat of turrets, and realizing I don't need to go under part progress stuff is nice and finished it. 
> 
> As of writing, about 1-3 weeks back I went under hiatus as I have left the mindus discord to take a break and move on for a little while. I should've done it after this pr so that I could get the feedback answered there rather than posted here... but it's fine. I got a lot of the conceptual feedback before then.
> 
> Btw, thanks Anuke to the initial feedback on making activation time clearer and the serp community for the initial feedback while the concept was developing. Deposit Cooldown being turret specific allows reactivity to fine-tuned (i.e. scatter should be reactive against air); and the sprite concept from Sire on making the turret grey tone was excellent. Also thanks to RZ for the advice regarding reactivity as an issue itself. I really hope this completely makes the game healthy as reactive turrets are now balancable! 
> 
> This isn't the end of the battle against reactivity, but this is a nice steppingstone for it.
> 
> Activation Time is ready, but I'm not sure on Deposit cooldown, hence the pr being set to draft... maybe in 1-3 weeks this pr becomes open? depends on if there are any major issues here.
> 
> After this pr, I would only start once I come back and ready to be in the community (if ever, the hiatus is indefinite). I'm still happy with my contributions here.

2813854526,Erekir vanquish rework + misc rebalance,EggleEgg,2025-09-10 01:53:04+00:00,,{},"### **Changes**
**Vanquish rework:** Old vanq is bad, but not terrible, too simple and with it s only real gimmick (crush damage) being useless against units and near unusable agaisnt fortifications, and not only this; but its frags dont actually work properly: the main gun's bullet has pierce, and at the end of the lifetime, it will summon its frags however, if the bullet pierces 2 targets, the bullet will NOT spawn its frags, leading to minimal damage.

- Vanquish now crushes ground units within a small area in front of it (up to 780 damage/s). Armor and bigger units are less affected by it
- Main weapon changed to a railgun, changed visual effects and sfx. Main gun applies negative knockback, pulling enemies closer and synergizing with its abilities. Increased overall dps, specially against structures. Secondaries have shorter range but no longer deal mediocre damage
- New ability, Last Stand: increased stats (speed, rotation speed, weapon rotation speed) the lower it s health becomes, allows vanquish to get closer and benefit from crushing and boost strength is visually displayed with fx
- Fix: frags spawn properly after main bullet pierces
- Increased tank assembler cost and time to produce (cyan 9 -> 12, power 150 -> 180, tungsten wall 10 -> 12, production time 50s -> 70s). Now interchangeable with mech assembler

These changes have been heavely tested and discussed in #erekir-balancing and other servers (such as evict), fitting most requirements from different communities and players and specially from those who disagreed in the poll
_Thanks to lixie for railvanq and Leno for railsquish_

**Scathe:** Phase ammo is quite useful, but not for its tanking and support capabilities, but rather it s guaranteed damage and large aoe
- Reduced phase speed significantly (4f -> 2.5f). Buffed shield (11.25-> 15 tiles,  2k -> 3k hp) and increased ammo eff (3 -> 5 ammo/item) to compensate
- Reduced phase overall damage (-25%)
- Increased hitsize for most missiles (6f -> 10f)
- Removed useless -9.0 tiles range for surge. Increased lifespam on frags by 12f for consistency

**Anthicus:** Duct armor no longer exists for missile units, but this can lead to anthicus being extremely difficult or outright impossible to deal against. Multiple proposals revolve into decreasing its suvivability which is less armor and less health and another idea was to decrease the missile's speed so it has less chances to hit

- health: 2900 -> 2700
- missile speed: 27.75(3.7f) -> 25.12(3.35f) (roughly a 10% decrease)

> Anthicus is a multipurpose unit, its missiles give it extra survivability which often block a few shots or delete certain units with a few salvos, also said salvos act as a shield  given enough units, so this is often troublesome to deal against, also its siege range allow it to deny a lot of area or put constant pressure with their sheer prescence
> Slower missiles should allow certain units to take down these missiles faster, effectively hindering their potential damage, also they would help on increasing the difference between anthicus and quell.
> Slower movement speed would hinder the unit's retreating capabilities, forcing players to bring support, should they not have any

**Quell:** Tecta s size increase in v8 made it no longer able to be picked up by quell (3.75, used to be 2.87), quell s payload is already a rarely used mechanic, removing the few synergies it had isnt good
- Increased payload capacity (3x3 -> 4x4)

2803198765,Enable non-linked blocks on processor deletion,cardillan,2025-09-05 17:11:05+00:00,,{},"A [recent commit](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/commit/3d3507dec94b122e34b58a221f5eac8a57771453) added the ability to control blocks that are not linked to the processor. This includes the ability to disable blocks.

When a processor is destroyed, linked blocks disabled by this processor are enabled. However, this omits disabled, non-linked blocks, since they aren't part of the link list and aren't processed.

This PR fixes it by keeping a separate set of blocks that were disabled by the processor. When the processor is destroyed, this set of disabled blocks is processed instead of the linked block list. The set is also stored in the map save (only valid blocks are saved in the list). I wasn't able to figure out an easier solution.

There's a potential problem: the list of disabled blocks may grow very large. Currently, invalid blocks aren't removed, so it is possible to create a logic that would grow the set beyond any limit (by creating, disabling and destroying blocks repeatedly). Not sure if this could be used for griefing; if it does, I'll add code to purge the set when a new block is being added to it.

Note: this is my first time altering the save/load process, it would be advisable to review my changes. I may have missed something (although I've tested it works as expected when saving and reloading a map).

To test the change including load/save mechanics, create two processors with the following code:

Processor A:

```
write @this processor1 ""p""
```

Processor B:

```
jump 0 equal p null
control enabled p 0 0 0 0
stop
```

Link processor B to A. Processor A becomes disabled without being linked to B, and B no longer keeps disabling it. Save/load the map, and delete processor B. Processor A becomes enabled (prior this PR, it stays disabled).

2787988773,Serpulo Rebalance (by blackberry2093 and community help),StalkerBaran,2025-08-31 18:52:36+00:00,,{},"In shortly (for those, who dont exist in #serpulo-rebalancing), this rebalance designed to fix most balance holes and improve gameplay keeping mindustry as vanilla as possible (almost nothing is reworked and not added new  (like 99% rebalance are stats changes)). It doesn't affect on campaign to much (it doesn't got much easier or harder), doesn't breaks any survival/attack maps, makes attack/pvp much more interesting and etc. This rebalance developed few months (started as rebalance mod (aka https://github.com/StalkerBaran/NewSerpuloBalanceYet) and finished with custom jar and pull request. Most players (in #serpulo-rebalancing and out of official mindustry discord server) accepted balance changes, most tests were made by me (from casual dps-tests and some mathematics on paper, to playtesting a lot pvp matches with new balance, rebeating campaign with new changes, custom maps and etc). My rebalance is not just changed numbers but detailed consideration of that how each unit will be used, what kind of synergy will be suitable, all kinds of tactics, and more more (without unusable units (like currently spirocts or arkiyd as example) or new meta, because I opened them myself in my own rebalance to fix them hahahahaasf). I'm typing this text in deep night and so tired, so I can explain about ALL changes tomorrow probably (if I find a free time), but most of them were explained in #serpulo-rebalance by pieces, some players even playtested). Considering that my changes in this channel seem to have been approved by everyone (because no one was completely involved in creating a rebalance for fixing all issues like me (except shadow, but he is doing a ton of documentation, doesn't have PvP experience or ~5k+ hours in game (To be honest, I dont have steam version to be sure how much hours I played, but I started to play in very early v6 version (or even v5 when I was smaller), was map maker (did a lot custom maps and even Naval Fortress for campaign rework), professional pvp player (so it gives true experience for finding balance issues because most campaign survival/attack maps depends from map creator and how it made, also pvp is a true headpain for creating perfect balance because players like to find ways for cheese or smartest way to play, their skill depends and etc), server moderator on few servers and creating MeowIsland (So I know how playing most novices, their minds, ...)

To understand why rebalance still need even in v8, you (I mean anuke and other players) should understand that most issues were nerfed by anuke (changes which doing unit rebalancing (Retusa, crawler (still meta T1 probably, but very depends from unit control)/unit rework (like scepter and its new shield ability) and general changes which understandable by everyone (like fixing armor for surge swarmer/cyclone lightnings and reactive damage (still meta because it slighty stronger than spectre spam, but still doesn't feels broken asf; fall damage meta (nerfing fall damage and decreasing DPS for swarmer/cyclone surge defense made itself this units from beta meta (dropping on core in pvp gameplay as base) from good meta (new hitboxes makes units more safety against AOE, making them more usable for split attacks and/or eco harass (or even core killing)). Also new RTS panel together with other balance changes makes (non meta) units more usable (not for real combat (except attack) but for challenging and funning). But v8 got new issues like corvus/omura meta ( insanely stupidly overpowered with new rts panel (hold fire abuse and foreshadow nerf), crawlers still very powerful T1 even with nerfs, flares still spammable even with nerfed fall damage, making most pvp matches and maps (outside of anuke maps) nearly unplayable without hand turret filling (for preventing early flare rushes on maps without antirush) and annoying with hand turret filling (flares could be produced by using raw resourses only (like copper and lead), making them spammable even on first minute (player doesn't have enough time to place an unloader to protect core or place scatters and with the supply of resources (no hand filling, but conveyor supply and much more. Overall, I can say that the v8's balance itself is much better than the v7's, but it still request massive polish and rethinking (as minimum to make pvp really playable and fix annoying corvus/omure meta on attack maps, as maximum make gameplay twice more interesting, more focused not on spamming the same type of units, but on coming up with tactics and using synergy (unit synergy like dagger + nova, scepter and vela and etc; turret synergy like swarmer/cyclone surge/blast + water tsunamy/cryo, making turrets more fair even if player try to use all buffs together (like overdome + cryo feed turret (this is a main reason, why cyclone/swarmer feels stronger than spectre (if we take into account the cost of turrets and how many they can be placed on a territory))

My rebalance could be accepted even today, because its much better than we have now. In general, it would be possible to make an accept now, but still the decision is up to Anuke, since I still need the opinion (and playtests!) of a much larger number of players (if I'm sure about the rebalance mode, then I'm not sure about the custom version, since I compared everything with the mod and didn't seem to find a difference between them, but I could still forget something). For those who wanna test changes, you can install rebalance mod or playtest on custom jar version (They are almost same, except that I dont support mod anymore, gonna work on custom jar only). All commits are compiles, custom jar works well (as I said, probably I'll be free tomorrow to collect all the pieces of my information from #serpulo-rebalancing and combine them into one piece of information that tells you what rebalancing does, and why it does it, and not something else (and common stats changes). I'm sure there will be people here who haven't even played it, but want to hate or say anything bad without reason, so please be understanding and at least give constructive criticism with screenshots, explanations, etc. Also I'm kinda bad in english (not native launguage) and working in github (Disclaimer). Also StainedMountains (campaign sector) need removed fast effect from spiroct in waves (optional, because it makes them very fast (unrebalanced spiroct with fast effect has nearly same speed as rebalanced spiroct without effect)
(I hope that I changed everything and wrote without mistakes, since I won't be able to read it until the morning, and that's not a fact)

**Tecta shield rework:** Old tecta s shield is sad, it has the potential to be good but gets hard countered hard by a long list of turrets and units (10+, ignoring ammo types). Even against basic projectiles such as the breach bullet it does not work properly due to how thin its, specially at lower fps (literally 60 or less) and in multiplayer
- Bigger and thicker shield, both visually and mechanically
- Now reflects bullets, with a 100% chance
- Pushes units away, including air (but not core units)
- Absorbs missiles, considering their hp * multiplier
- Tweaked some stats to double down even more on the shield

Now tecta has only 4 real counters: malign, lustre, sublimate and locus

**Tank tree:** Why can conquer and high tier units get obliterated in under 5 seconds by some puddle of slag or water?  Why are tanks slowed down by terrain just as much as other units?
- T3+ tier tanks now have melting and burning immunity
- Unit size considered in drowning calculations. Drowning multipliers for all units removed or changed to maintain old values
- Tanks treads work like  tank treads, less affected by slow terrain. The higher the tier the lower the multiplier. Added support for 1> multipliers (more affected) for modders or whatever
- Added crush damage stat and slightly increased hitbox requirement (0.75), since it is rather restrictive

**Quell/Disrupt suppression:** While not bad it is rather underwhelming, specially for an ability that is meant for support. It s likely I ll further rework it in ~~6 millennia~~ soon affecting more structures and with tiers, to differentiate the 2 units, suppression.
- Now affects unit repair towers (since it mentions it in the descriptions, rather than only the regen projector)

**Scathe:** Even with surge frags dealing lower dps it still is a generally better option than carbide, with its spread and 500 effective frag hp it is no joke for survivability.
- Nerfed surge frag and main missile hp (-50% and -25%)
- Slightly buffed carbide hp

**Collaris:** Still overall the best T5, massive range, great dps

- Nerfed lifespam and frag damage (-25%), slightly buffed main bullet. Max overrange is now consistent with disrupts

**Disperse:** buffed thor ammo overrange, still rather niche and disliked

2731408998,"[DRAFT] Many balancing changes, stat and mechanical",SomeonesShade,2025-08-08 17:40:49+00:00,,{},"[Last Updated August 8/9]
### What is this?

A set of unfinished balancing changes that will be reiterated until completion. Hence draft.
It's not done, I can't discuss changes I'm not confident in, and some will be pruned at the end for when it's time for release (maybe next month at minimum, can be more.). #balancing - please don't judge early, I need to refine and feel what the changes should be, and I may just say ""it's not yet done / I need to see for myself / still iterating/brainstorming / etc.""

### Why the draft?

I need something to reference quickly when needed, and hopefully as something that could motivate me as this is a large undertaking, that will affect almost every single turret and unit in some capacity. Also, in the case when the plan fails, there are some changes that may be ready to go and should be merged at least. 

It's a high chance of failure... as...
- Map Impact: This may screw up with campaign maps, will need reevaluation before release
- Many weak points: due to the changes all intermingled and potentially dependent, if one fails, a lot of damage can occur.

### What changes?

There are many, will need documentation and explanation, and then discussion.

The ones that are already in the pr (to name a few):
- Reactivity Nerfs: Autofill and Lancer/Arc
- Armor Multiplier for Armor Weakness, Armor Piercing, and Anti-Armor
- Scorch being viable for PvP lol
- Ground vs Air Alleviations
- Inter-Ammo Balancing
- and more...

(Not finished... there are some things I've missed/haven't done yet... so if you see an issue... I may be thinking/working on it)

There are some ideas that are in circulation and needs to be finished at some point...
- Hail and Ripple being made more positional.
- Naval being balanceable. (If the idea works, it works!)
- Pyra/Blast Ammo Rework/Changes
- Swarmer/Cyclone Tech Appropriation

Well, still in the mind/brainstorming stage and won't be elaborated but showcases how ambitious the project is....

I hope this survives somewhat, there are so many things I want to do and be seen that would fix the game's mechanical issues.
This may become the biggest pr I'll ever make... It just takes time.

### Misc.

Activation Timer commit may brick your savefile if you downgrade... I have no clue how to not let that happen, or if there is a better way to implement it...

2697101976,No cooldown on drop to air,cardillan,2025-07-26 14:05:11+00:00,,{},"Removes the cooldown when dropping items to air. Spamming drop to air should not be a problem, because after the first one the state won't actually change. Not sure if there are other reasons for the cooldown apart from preventing a too fast item transfer between nearby blocks - if there are, I guess this won't be possible to accept.

Again, inspired by the logic jam: it is difficult to use logic to mine an exact amount of items, e.g. when feeding a block using a unit. Just mining until the desired amount is reached often leads to an additional item being held, which then often incurs the cooldown just to get rid of it.

A nicer alternative would be to add support for mining an exact amount of items, but that would require change to the instruction (a new parameter) and would be actually more complicated, since mining - unike itemDrop and itemTake - isn't instantaneous.

When activated, the 1000 instruction limit is not enforced at all. The primary use-case is to allow running code which, after adding debugging support, overflows the instruction limit.

Notes:
-  I'm clearing the flag when loading a map in campaign mode, because the `allowEditWorldProcessors` is being cleared there too. The flag should never be set in campaign, so it feels right. I'm not sure about other game modes.
- If no limit at all is not desirable for some reasons, the setting could just increase the limit (maybe double it).

As of right now, this impacts only mods.
To trigger this quirk in the base game you need to attach the same root ``TechNode`` to both the ``Planets.sun`` and ``Planets.serpulo``, for example, because ``sun`` is added to the ``content.planets()`` seq first. (e.g. both need to have the same ``Planet.techTree`` instance attached to them)

Other parts of the game is not impacted by the fix.
Also, I'm not sure who decided to use ``ObjectMap<Sector, ItemSeq> cache = new ObjectMap<>();`` to work with associated sectors, but he/she allowed to implement this change without any problems. Cheers!

2662041837,Setting null to counter should be a no-op,cardillan,2025-07-13 07:05:05+00:00,2025-07-17 22:45:48+00:00,{},"In the past, setting `null` to `@counter` (or any object value for that matter) was a no-op. Recent updates changed this behavior in such a way that setting `@counter`to `null` sets `@counter` to 0. The former behavior was used by some (e.g., a calling a null function pointer resulted in a no-op).

This PR restores the original behavior.

(Another way to fix the problem would be to create a special subclass of LVar for counter, which would make it more apparent in the code for other developers in the future, but I believe LVar not having subclasses allows for better optimization by JIT at runtime. I may be mistaken, though.)

Change in the functions.
1. copyFromCpu(). removed if statement and made 2 loops for both coordinates to avoid division and modulo.
2. rotatePlans(). Changed code a little bit to make less calculations. I had left if statements inside of the loop because compiler will remove it (at the least I think so)
3. flipPlans(). Changed code a little bit to make less calculations. I had left if statements inside of the loop because compiler will remove it (at the least I think so)

New constants.
1. public static final int halftilesize = tilesize/2;
2. public static final int doubletilesize = tilesize*2;
Introducing them to maybe potentially replace code alike tilesize/2 or tilesize*2 to reduce computations (If going to be used)

Just for a notice
copyFromCpu() function prob needs to do scanlines. I can try to do it if it is required. For right now it is just a little improvement.

Implementation details:
- Refactored some variable names and code blocks for easier reading.
- Created ``canRedirectExports`` method which determines if the provided sector's launch pads can be redirected to the player's current sector. This method is used in both the button's disabled attribute and during execution of redirecting sectors.

Testing details:
- Utilized Windows instructions for compilation and running the application;
- Used save file from Steam's ""v8-beta"" branch;
- Selected a sector which contained both a launch and landing pad of the same resource. Before the changes, the button would remain enabled after pressing it. After the changes, the button now remains disabled (as all other sectors were already exporting to that sector).

## Added
- A method to remove a DOS blacklisted IP.
- A command to add, remove, and list DOS blacklisted IPs.
- A line to log when a connection is being kicked for being a DOS blacklisted IP.

## Changes
- Switched the double-spaces in the subnet-ban command's listing to instead use a tab. This is better for accessibility and customization. 

## Justifications
- Some mods will accidentally trigger a DOS blacklist. The server only logs the trigger, but it doesn't log anything when the player is kicked for having an IP that is on the DOS blacklist. This can cause confusion for server owners/admins that are trying to resolve a connection issue.
- There is no built-in way to correct this issue other than by running Javascript. The Javascript that is necessary to correct this issue can be confusing to certain individuals, and running unknown Javascript code can pose a significant risk to those that aren't familiar with programming and security.
- While a lot of IDEs encourage using spaces instead of actual tabs (from my knowledge) -- this can cause issues for accessibility. Some individuals may rely on the tab character (denoted by `\t`) to be able to properly read text and information on a screen. Using spaces instead of the tab character can make it harder for an individual that relies on the tab character to be able to access all of the features of the headless Mindustry server. Additionally, the length of tabs can be customized on a local level, so having this level of customization can potentially benefit individuals that would want to customize the length of their tabs (even if they don't need it for accessibility)."

Currently only returns the number of drawflushes performed on a display. Since the property is not stored in a map file, it can be used to detect situations where the display needs to be redrawn. The counter is a 32bit value, treated as unsigned to double the range.

(I've intentionally chosen a non-specific name for the property, as perhaps it might be used to be able to sense the number of operations performed by other objects too - turrets firing, factories producing, etc.)

I get the amount obtained in the process through 
```
refundedItems[i] += accepting;
```
Because itemsLeft[i] = totalCost[i] - usedItems[i] + refundedItems[i]
So I get usedItems[i], and then I get the total amount that should be given to you, that is, totalRefundItems[i] = usedItems[i] * deconstructMultiplier, and then I use totalRefundItems[i - refundedItems[i] to get the most accurate amount of compensation.

But even so, I found other problems. For example, if deconstructMultiplier = 2, I spent 7 coppers to build it, and refundedItems[i] = 15, it gave me one more, which means that I can't give it, but I have to reduce it by one."

- **P3:** The large variants need to be buffed as their usecase is fairly limited to downright unknown.

### Main Changes
Payload Mass Driver 
[**P1** Buff] *(Reduced Cost, make it more spammable/usable compared to earlygame util)*
Tungsten: 120 -> 40
Silicon: 120 -> 50
Graphite 50 -> 20

Large PMD
[**P3** Overall Buff] *(Made more powerful/capable, but tech locked it a bit higher)*
Thorium: 200 -> Phase Fabric: ~20 [Moved From Large Constructor]
Range: 1100 [137.5] -> 2100 [262.5, 3x pmd range]
Max Payload Size: 3.5 -> ~~5~~ 4

Small Deconstructor 
[**P2** Buff] *(focusing on a point and multiple spike design: multiple constructors into one deconstructor)*
Deconstruct Speed: 1 -> 3

Deconstructor 
[**P3** Buff] *(Focusing on more yield to be in contact with the core, pre phase massive vault yield)*
Carbide: 250 -> 50
Deconstruct Speed: 2 -> 6

Constructor 
[**P2** Buff] *(More Spam-able in Cost, contrast with loader setups)*
Silicon: 100 -> ~50
Beryllium: 150 -> ~75
Tungsten: 80 -> 40
ConsumePower: 2 (120 pu/s) -> 2.5 (150 pu/s)

Large Constructor 
[**P3** Buff] *(~Made more cheaper, could be potential for 3by3 turret/build tower on future parts, or having vault tech early but limited on pay conveyors, also quell isn't needed anymore for having vaults present)*
Oxide: 150 -> 100
Phase Fabric: 40 -> Thorium: 80
ConsumePower: 2 (120 pu/s) -> 3 (180 pu/s)

Payload Loader
[(Counter Balance) Neutral: Only Tungsten Cost Buff] *(Counternerfed, by having 100% of the cost reduction to 4xPMD setups (except for tungsten with 50%) toward loader and unloader as a whole. Loader taking less of the hit to incentivize the new behavior in Part 2.)*
Graphite: 50 -> ~80
Silicon: 50 -> ~160
Tungsten: 80 -> ~90

Payload Unloader
[(Counter Balance) Neutral: Only Tungsten Cost Buff] *(see above, this is going to take most of the cost reshuffling to incentivize Part 2 behavior)*
Graphite: 50 -> ~140
Silicon: 50 -> ~220
Tungsten: 30 -> ~180

### Counter Balance
Constructor Reduction getting counterbalanced for Assemblers (T4/T5)
With T4 usually having 1 Constructor and T5 having 2 (Thanks to mwm for the [values](https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/1356090714563281066/1376006349846220920) needed for counterbalance, and I rounded the values up to make it look good overall
Edit: ~With the new updated information... the 150 raw item reduction actually works out... its effectively neutral for the cost reduction

All blocks involved: -30 pu/s
Tank Assembler: +150 Silicon
Ship Assembler: +50 Tungsten, +100 Silicon
Mech Assembler: +50 Tungsten, +100 Silicon
Assembler Module: +50 Oxide

# Part 2: New Loader Behavior

#### Old Behavior

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b361b2-e44f-4fec-8785-3f7e73dd07dd

#### New Behavior
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e88f8f7e-eaa3-42b7-a057-b0e6f3734461

### Rationale
_Behavior: Only export if the item has reached max capacity, and that the item is present in the loader itself._
This was one of my desires when I've looked at loader and found a seamless and should be non-buggy way to do it.
This would allow players to chain loaders from multiple locations, snaking around, all to reach the final destination! This would be a nice gameplay addition to anyone playing around the payload system.

2534667534,Map reloads counter - new processor variable,cardillan,2025-05-21 14:57:19+00:00,2025-06-04 18:50:05+00:00,{},"Adds a `@mapReloads` processor variable. The variable is set to zero on code compilation, and gets incremented each time a map is loaded. It serves for easy detection of map reload events (either from a save file, or by switching a sector in campaign). Since display content is not stored in the map file, this allows programs that update their display incrementally to detect the display needs to be fully redrawn. There might be other use cases; maybe world processors could trigger some events in custom maps when a map gets loaded.

Reload detection is possible in two ways: firstly, the last value of `@mapReloads` can be stored in a variable; when a difference is found, the stored value is updated and the display is redrawn. Secondly, since `@mapReloads` is writable, it is possible to set it back to zero when a non-zero value, and thus a map reload, is detected.

The variable is displayed in the **Vars** screen, which makes it perhaps more prominent than it deserves. If this is a problem, I'll try to add a fix to hide it from this list. (I've also added it to the list of built-in variables, even though `@counter` isn't there.)

Notes:
* I'm not aware of any other mechanism to detect map reloads (except ""ghost cells"", which is not really all that usable), despite asking around. If there already is another way, then this can be scrapped - I'd just like to know what is the way.
* Map reloads could be tracked within the map itself. Adding a just processor variable seemed simpler to me - the code added is minimal. The possibility to reset the flag independently by each processor is a bonus which makes using the variable easier.

![{CA08FE87-0CC4-43CD-9E0F-57EE98B5F7E8}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e7cbc5-6b2e-4458-ac86-a4fb88833b97)

I've used the refresh icon for the command. It looks quite fitting to me, but I can try to draw a new one if requested (e.g. a loop with an arrow pointing to the top).

The command resets all variables and restarts the processor (by enforcing recompilation). This operation is needed when the code in the processor performs some one-time initialization, and the user wants to re-run the initialization. Currently, the following workarounds are possible:

- Making a small modification to the program to force recompilation: not always practical, potentially dangerous.
- Implement the reinitalization logic in the logic code itself, e.g. on a switch: this is often not needed outside of code development, adding unnecessary cruft to logic. At the same time adding it ad-hoc to a program when it becomes needed may be error-prone, time-consuming and just not worth it.

That makes it impossible to parse this number in hexadecimal or binary when entered as an unsigned value: `print 0xFFFFFFFF80000000; printflush message1` outputs `null`.

This PR changes the number values used to indicate invalid numbers to `Long.MIN_VALUE` / `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

`Long.MIN_VALUE` cannot be parsed in any form anyway due to the limitations in `Strings.parseLong`. (To fix that, the arc library would have to be patched.) This PR therefore removes the limitation of not being able to parse `Integer.MIN_VALUE` without introducing any new non-parseable values.

After the fix, the following code

```
print -99
print ""\n""
print 99
print ""\n""
print -0xFF
print ""\n""
print 0xFF
print ""\n""

For non-rectangular displays, everything outside `(0, 0) - (displayWidth - 1, displayHeight - 1)` is either outside any single display, or covered by a frame.

I've hard-coded the frame width into the code, because I don't know how to obtain the frame width in a more systematic way.

I've tested the PR with a few display transformations (rotate, translate) and it appears to be working as expected.

2472118747,Erekir more balancing round up and power rebalanced,EggleEgg,2025-04-21 21:57:37+00:00,2025-04-27 14:42:44+00:00,{},"### Describe what you would like changed, and why.

   **Sublimate:**
   Liquid usage 10/s -> 15/s
   Cyanogen 1.5x ammo multiplier 
_Ozone sub is too dominant an option in PvE. This will tamp down its convenience as an all-in-one defensive option._

   **Merui:** 
   Rate of fire decreased to ~95% (60->63 frames)
   Range: 18->17 tiles

   **Mech Fabricator:** 
   Tungsten:  60->5
   Graphite: 300->0
   Beryllium: 0->250
   
_Merui's extreme tungsten cost excludes it from being a practical choice. With slight modification merui will be balanced without it, and the berry discount likewise makes the unit usable without awkward rollouts. Balance point assumes cost performance parity with stell at 20 merui. Merui becomes a soft counter for stell above that._

   **Cleroi:** 
   Rate of fire decreased to ~.90% (60->66 frames). 
   Speed decreased to ~85%•

   **Mech refabricator:** 
   Tungsten: 120->175

_Cleroi is too good at too many things. Lowering its DPS will force it to be used as a support tool rather than a dominant option. Lowering its speed limits its ability to snipe cores._

   **Precept:** 
   Hitbox: 3.25^2 ->3.0^2.
   Turret rotation: Improved to 125%•
    Consider changing into a punchier sfx for the cannon•

_While balanced on open terrain, precept is still a little too awkward and suffers badly in chokepoints. A modest decrease to hitbox size lets 17% more units fit in the same space and a faster turret speed lets precept fire while maneuvering to imitate Tecta's maneuverability)
(Hitbox reduction may be rejected based on the problem of visual of overlap, or reduced to 3.125^2_

   **Avert:** 
   Unit rotation speed: Raised to 200%

   **Ship refabricator:** 
  Oxide: 40->15
  Beryllium: 200->250
  Tungsten: 100->120

_While Avert needs to retain its oxide cost to delay its rush potential,  a lower oxide cost will let it deploy quickly enough to be useful. Faster rotation will make it more fun and rewarding as a micro-intensive unit without helping it in army fights_

**Quell**: https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/404384551037698065/1362620039164858378

_Quell is indisputably underpowered and requires a rework to be buffed safely. Details linked._

   **Silicon arc:** 360>300

   **Surge crucible** 120>90

   **T1 Fabricators:** 120>90
   
   **T3 Prime Refabricator:** 300>270 
_compensation to keep pace with T4's extra T1 count_

   **Chemical Combustion Chamber:** 550 power
_zeroed at 6 CCC to 3 silicon arcs and 3 T1's_
   Tungsten cost: 40>20
_For printing speed and electrolysis count_

   **Pyrolysis:** 1500>1250 power
_Edit: Change was raised from 1200 to 1250 to increase backwards map compatibility._

   **Flux reactor:** 14,400>15,900 power
   Carbide cost: 200>100
   Surge cost: 300>200

   **Neoplasia reactor:**
   Phase cost: 300>150
   Tungsten cost: 1000>750

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2d4aa31-6317-4df8-9f18-da654f118a83)

The goals with this rework are to increase early power availability, buff units across the board to keep up with the newly added defensive options, buff T1 especially to fill niche roles like HP tank alongside T2, and to encourage use of flux and neoplasia as options in normal length games not just the ultra lategame. Flux and surge production needed additional buffs and Pyrolysis an especially large nerf. Calculations below are expected to be accurate enough to be indicative.

2471199148,fix: correct loop variable from i to j in TilePreChangeEvent's nearby check,Haerbin23456,2025-04-21 12:45:31+00:00,2025-04-21 13:32:26+00:00,{},"## What was the issue?
In `TilePreChangeEvent` handling, there was a nested loop where:
```java
for(int j = 0; j < 4; j++){
    Tile othernear = other.nearby(i); // ❌ Used `i` instead of `j`
}
```
This caused the inner loop to **always check the same direction** (`i` from outer loop) instead of iterating through all 4 directions.

## What does this fix do?
- Changes `other.nearby(i)` to `other.nearby(j)` to properly check all adjacent tiles.

## Impact
- Fixes potential incorrect pathfinding updates when tiles are modified.
- No gameplay-breaking issues, but improves internal consistency.

- **Oxide titan nerf**: Decreased rof. Oxide vastly outperforms even old carbide against swarms
- **Carbide titan rework**: Increased single target dps, armor piercing frag, decreased area of effect. Fits better into high tier unit counter role vs old ""thorium but better"". Added fx so it s a bit more interesting
- **Carbide scathe nerf**: after better v7 and v8 testing people in #erekir-balancing and even Someone’s Shadow have concluded that the [massive buff](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/commit/e61deb05ec588d7c12c1dcaf67f936fcec6291f3) wasnt as needed so it s been toned down
- **Afflict nerf**: Increased building mult, nerfed homing and lifespam, limited pierce to 3. Nerfs the reactive aspect of the turret and how good it is against swarms and single target (vastly outperforming disperse and titan). Now it only has great single target, instead of both

2464518616,Disperse ammo rebalance,EggleEgg,2025-04-16 20:48:45+00:00,2025-04-16 21:21:26+00:00,{},"Thor ammo was a bit too overtuned and sili was slightly underwhelming
### Changes

- Thor gets massively reduced range to compensate for it s high dps and increased ammo consumption. Essentially your erekir fuse at 23.75 tiles
- Silicon gets it s rof reduction removed and increased ammo multiplier, as well as incredibly minor damage increase (5.7%) that allows it to shoot down anthicus missiles in 2 shots instead of 3 (previously it would be left with -2.5 hp which was annoying)

Small fix for the autoPause fix, apparently it wasn't checking for the game state before running, therefore overwriting the state to not be menu on server load and making it impossible to host"
2461484315,Scathe ammo rebalance,EggleEgg,2025-04-15 18:50:37+00:00,2025-04-16 04:08:35+00:00,{},"Currently surge ammo is wayyy overtuned. Not only it is strictly superior to carbide (roughtly 60% higher dps with ONLY frags) , but some have worried that even carbide might be slightly overpowered as well (subject to change, I m happy to add carbide damage nerfs and repost the pr on public opinion). 

### Changes

- Surge ammo gets a slight rework to essentially become a shotgun, worse performance at long range than carbide but much better at close. Also reduced spread so the frags miss less at close range
- Carbide gets a nerf to building multiplier since it was never meant to be a building siege weapon (and is already mediocre at it anyways)
- Phase gets reduced ammo mult, 3 phase per shot is quite cheap for it s tanking capabilities + decent aoe

Weapon switch to burst-fire rail bullet type but colored like regular laser, also creates AOE incendiary frag. 

The weapon would struggle against large armored units due to low damage per shot & small AOE range on frag but gets extra building damage multiplier to maintain siege ability. 

The multiplier could get tweak to change the time needed to break defense without affecting anti-unit strength. 

Also the rail bullet has to destroy all obstacles in the way to reach final target, unlike hit-scan / pierce property of laser. Therefore balancing is easier without the need to limit its range & instant-hit nature, keeping corvus from being anti-everything by long range attack damage stacking.

2353613945,"Add Keyboard Shortcut for ""Next Wave"" Feature",neoBedjo,2025-02-24 13:05:33+00:00,2025-04-04 17:39:32+00:00,{},"### Pull Request: Add Keyboard Shortcut for ""Next Wave"" Functionality

#### Problem Description
Currently, there is no keyboard shortcut available for triggering the ""next wave"" feature in Mindustry. This limitation restricts the ability to integrate the game into interactive platforms like Twitch, Youtube, TikTok, where user actions (e.g., sending gifts) could trigger specific in-game events. Additionally, players who prefer keyboard shortcuts over mouse clicks lack an alternative input method for this functionality.

#### Proposed Solution
I have implemented a new keyboard shortcut (`F9`) to trigger the ""next wave"" functionality. This addition enables users to map an action (e.g., pressing `F9`) to advance to the next wave in the game. The shortcut is intuitive and can be further configured or remapped if needed.

This feature enhances interactivity and engagement, particularly for streamers using platforms like TikTok, Twitch, or YouTube. For example:
- When viewers send virtual gifts during a live stream, the gift could trigger the ""next wave"" shortcut.
- This creates a dynamic and engaging experience for both the streamer and their audience.

#### Implementation Details
- Added a new keyboard shortcut (`F9`) to trigger the ""next wave"" functionality.
- Ensured compatibility with existing game mechanics and ensured no conflicts with other shortcuts.
- The shortcut is simple to use and integrates seamlessly into the game's current input system.

#### Use Case
Streamers using TikTok or similar platforms can configure the game to respond to viewer interactions:
- Gifts sent by viewers simulate a trigger (via the proposed shortcut) to start the next wave automatically.
- This creates a more interactive and entertaining experience for both the streamer and their audience.

#### Benefits of This Feature
1. **Integration with Streaming Platforms**:
   - Enables streamers to create engaging, interactive experiences by linking viewer actions (e.g., sending gifts) to in-game events.
   - Enhances the entertainment value of live streams and encourages audience participation.

2. **Improved Accessibility**:
   - Provides an alternative input method for players who prefer keyboard shortcuts over mouse clicks.
   - Makes the game more accessible to users with different preferences or physical limitations.

3. **Enhanced Gameplay Customization**:
   - Allows players to tailor their gameplay experience to their liking.
   - Aligns with modern gaming trends that emphasize personalization and player agency.

4. **Filling a Niche for Interactive Gaming**:
   - Positions Mindustry as a forward-thinking option for creators looking to leverage interactive mechanics in their content.
   - Attracts a broader audience, including streamers and content creators.

#### Additional Context
The implementation of this feature is lightweight and non-intrusive. It aligns with the game's existing architecture and does not introduce significant complexity. The simplicity of adding a keyboard shortcut makes this a low-effort, high-impact improvement that greatly benefits the game's ecosystem.

#### Requested Outcome
- A new keyboard shortcut (`F9`) to trigger the ""next wave.""

#### How This Feature Will Improve the Game
Adding a keyboard shortcut for the ""next wave"" functionality will significantly enhance the interactivity and versatility of Mindustry, especially in modern gaming and streaming environments. By enabling players to trigger the next wave via a simple keypress, this feature opens up new gameplay options and use cases:
- Integration with streaming platforms like TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube.
- Improved accessibility for players who prefer keyboard shortcuts.
- Enhanced gameplay customization and personalization.
- Filling a niche for interactive gaming and community-driven content.

This feature positions Mindustry as a more versatile and engaging game, attracting a broader audience and enhancing the overall player experience.

---

### Testing
- Verified that the `F9` shortcut triggers the ""next wave"" functionality correctly.
- Ensured no conflicts with existing shortcuts or game mechanics.
- Tested in various scenarios, including single-player and multiplayer modes.

### Future Considerations
- Explore the possibility of making the shortcut configurable via the game's settings menu.
- Investigate compatibility with external tools or APIs for programmatic triggering.

---

Thank you for considering this contribution! I believe this feature will add significant value to Mindustry and its community. Let me know if any additional changes or clarifications are needed.

Block build cost reduced & switched raw ores to refined materials.

Unit production speed increased to prevent game being too lengthy especially in end-game attack maps.

Reduced cryo consumption to accommodate space & water limitation on map, while greatly increased power consumption to encourage the use of impact reactor & overdrive.

(T4 factory requires 5 differential to power, T5 factory needs ~2 impacts, not too difficult to setup (due to power production could be setup wherever convenient) while still within acceptable level if player use thorium reactor / differential gen instead.)

While experimenting with the power diode, I found inconsistencies in its behavior.

Its purpose is to transfer power when the back power graph has a higher percentage of stored energy than the front power graph, but it doesn't actually intend to balance them that way.

For example, a fully charged large battery will transfer 50000 * (1 - 0) / 2 = 25000 energy (clamped to 4000) to a small battery. However, intuitively it should be around 3700.

This code fixes the issue. I also believe that there is no longer any need for the clamp or for dividing by 2, but it remains unchanged.

I believe that the mod Aeyama should be removed from the mod browser due to botted stars. The mod is of impressively low quality, which isn't a bad thing by itself, but it has over a hundred stars and counting despite its low quality. Additionally, at https://github.com/Aeyama-Mod/aeyama/stargazers, you can see that the majority of Aeyama's stars are from generic bot accounts.

<img width=""1132"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c2ffab-7ed5-46a7-8b13-64bcd7b204cb"" />

The users not suspected to be bots have had their profiles censored for privacy. Within these two screenshots, there are 33 users who have starred the mod, but only seven have non-default profile pictures. Some of the users with default profile pictures are real, but it's very few. The second of the two screenshots is still on the Aeyama stargazers page, you can check it to verify.

<img width=""1777"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/876fd72f-40a4-41c7-adf5-62c80a10b620"" />

<img width=""1805"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/408b4db8-ea95-4127-90b7-e80fc99e4eda"" />
These three screenshots contain three of the bot accounts. Note how all have only starred Aeyama, except for the last one having their own (empty) repository starred as well.

Checking the stargazers page for another popular mod, such as BetaMindy, the vast majority of the users either have non-default profile pictures or have default profiles and are active in, and have starred, other repositories. I believe this indicates that Aeyama's abnormally high concrentration of suspected bot accounts were used for botting stars to illegitimately increase the popularity of the repository.

Others have expressed similar sentiment in the past as well, particularly in the modding chats in the Discord. Their usernames have been censored for privacy, but all of these messages can be found in the Discord, if verification is necessary.

To cap it off, there is a large amount of evidence implying Aeyama has illegitimately gained stars to inflate the popularity of the mod. I am not the only person to think it should be removed from the mod browser for this, as others with a similar viewpoint are posted above."

the value added to the actual seed is now a constant 7 (except for 2 colored noisemeshes in which case the color seed has 8 added instead of 7, as in the base game the seed used for the color is planet.id + seed + 1) instead of the planet's id since thats the planet id of most modded planets. this way mods that add only 1 planet dont have to make any changes to keep their planet's appearance

additionally, the makeAsteroid function now has a seed value so that gier, notva and verlius (verilus?) dont look different after this pr since they use noisemeshes

This method replaces `:duo:` with the duo icon (and similarly with other content), without the need to check for character id. I originally wanted to override `Core.bundle` so that I could override `get` and `format` to automatically do this to every bundle entry; that way it'd be easier to create bundles and potentially have modded content icon support. However I could not find an easy way to do that, so for now it's just this method.

I didn't realize casting `double` to `long` truncates towards zero and broken the formatting for negative numbers. Sorry for the blunder.

To fix it, I've replaced the casting with `Math.round()`, which works for all `double` values and returns a `long` out of the box. This works for all numbers up to `2^63 - 1` - the largest long that can de represented by a `double`.

Test code:

```
set a 0.0000000001
set two 2
op sub b 1 a
op add c 1 a
op sub d -1 a
op add e -1 a
op pow __tmp4 two 53
op sub x __tmp4 1
op add f x a
op add g x 0.5
op pow __tmp8 two 63
op sub h __tmp8 1
print b
print ""\n""
print c
print ""\n""
print d

print e
print ""\n""
print f
print ""\n""
print g
print ""\n""

This PR implements this suggestion: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/5319.

Currently, numbers slightly above an integer are rounded down to the integer when printed/displayed, but numbers slightly below an integer aren't rounded. The PR makes the numbers slightly below an integer rounded towards the integer value too.

Test code:

```
print 0.9999999999
print ""\n""
print 1.0000000001
printflush message1
```

Before the change, the code outputs:

```
0.9999999999
1
```

After the change, the code outputs

```
1

This allows you to use a variable name for the natural parameter without compromising your access to the x and y parameters.

2152679614,Team Color refactor for modding,CliffracerX,2024-10-30 00:34:29+00:00,2025-02-09 16:15:37+00:00,{},"Implements setPalette() with two variants; either generating a palette from a single color (as the green & blue teams do), or filling one out from three manually provided colors.  This doesn't de-Finalize ``color``, ``palette``, or ``palettei`` as the setters still work.  This refactors the Team constructors to use setPalette as well to avoid code bloat.

This also allows overriding sprites that aren't in the atlas using sprite-overrides, though the warning has been left in to alert people to potential out-of-date mods.

This is realistically only going to matter to a small number of uber-nerds in the community by allowing team color editing in mods.  If there's a performant way to alter colors at runtime, that could be cool for scripted maps or similar, but I otherwise expect this to mostly be used for some simple recoloring mods/use in full conversions to freshen things up.

Inside `DirectConsumerTests.java`:
- Added 2 partition tests for varying inputs for Power requests. Goal is to test more types of inputs to ensure proper efficiency
`noPowerRequestedWithNoItemsParameterized()`
`noPowerRequestedSufficiencyParameterized()`

Inside `ApplicationTests.java`
- Added 5 functional tests to ensure proper game states during campaign game mode
`runSectorCaptured()`
`runBossWave()`
`wavesActiveStateTest()`
`waveCountdownStateTest()`
`gameOverStateTest()`

- Increased test coverage inside `Logic.java` with a new test case (more line, method and branch coverage)
`fogOfWarUpdateTest()`

- Increased test coverage inside `ItemModule.java` with 4 new test cases (increase in method, line and branch coverage)
`addingEntireTileContentsTile()`
`itemModuleIDCoal()`
`itemModuleByItemCoal()`
`itemStackRemoveAndVerifyCheck()`

- Increased test coverage inside `Turret.java` with new test case
`testAmmoLoadingCap()`

- Increased test coverage inside `Drill.java` with 3 new test cases
`testDrillTypes()`
`testDrillWithWater()`
`testDrillOres()`

- Increased test coverage inside `Distribution Package` with 3 new test cases
`testDistributor()`
`testUnloader()`
`testOverflowGate()`

- Added test case to improve testability with testing of liquid flow. This test also uses 2 new methods inside `Conduit.java` and `BuildingComp.java` aimed at our dummy methods. Goal here is to have these methods simplify logic for the purpose of testability in relation to liquid flow systems.
`liquidJunctionOutputTestability()`

- Use of mocking to further test `Logic` execution, and `Turret` building. NOTE: Kinda worried about the Mockito package inclusion because it may be incompatible. May need clarification here.
`mockVerifyLogicGameStateReset()`
`logicMockTest()`
`mockTurretBuildVerification()`


Also addition of more comments to touched methods inside `DirectConsumerTests.java`, and `ApplicationTests,java`

[^1]: With both Dynamic Jump Heights and Trapezoidal Jumps, I'd estimate the complexity determining jump heights is about `O(k^2 + n)` where `k` is the number of unique end destinations and `n` the number of jump curves. 

# Overview

The goal of this PR is to [improve jump UI](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/5000).
As such, this competes with @MEEPofFaith's #9925 and Foo's Client's [implementation](https://github.com/mindustry-antigrief/mindustry-client/blob/v7/core/src/mindustry/logic/LCanvas.java#L173).

This PR adds in three features[^2]:
- **Dynamic Jump Heights**: Jump curves now adjust themselves to be more legible.
- **Colored Jumps**: Jump curves are colored based on their destination. (Contributed by @Ilya246)
- **Trapezoidal Jumps**: Jump curves now look trapezoidal to improve performance[^3] (Suggested by @Arkanic)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9e1e31a-a536-41a1-a0a6-5c5aa2e395d6)

[^2]: I've decided that these three features belong in one PR because they complement each other.
    Still, I've made them configurable in separate settings anyway.

[^3]: It improves both graphical rendering of the jumps *and* the implementation of Dynamic Jump Heights.

# Tested feature combinations

I think fixing Trapezoidal Jumps and Colored + Trapezoidal Jumps implies reimplementing Dynamic Jump Heights in some form or another.
I don't think there's an alternative, but I could make Trapezoidal Jumps require Dynamic Jump Heights.

[^4]: Runs slower on logic with a lot of jumps.

1990137188,Added elapsed time counter,ih295,2024-07-26 21:30:57+00:00,2024-07-27 02:34:01+00:00,{},"So, updating this: all this code does is benchmark the performance of the update function in the Logic class. It measures how long it takes for the game to complete its update function per ms, averaged over a second.

Old Pull Request: With this update, a simple boolean-enabled elapsed time feature is added. All this does is show how much time elapses between every frame while updating it. This counter outputs that every second via logging to console. This update can and should be ignored, as it is only being done for a pull request. In that pull request, we are to detail said elapsed time as well as frame rate measured by running 3  relatively large-scale games.

I was tasked to benchmark Mindustry on games with thousands of blocks. I found three relatively large games with hundreds of nodes, potentially thousands. Each of these games were joined twice, and played for 10 minutes for accurate data. For the first map, on the first join, I got a frame rate of 20, and an elapsed time of 31830 milliseconds averaged over a minute. For the second join, it was 30 frames, with an elapsed time per frame of 32071 milliseconds averaged over a minute.

For the second map, on first join, the frame rate was 26, and its elapsed time was 26409 milliseconds. With respect to its second join, the frame rate was 19, and the elapsed time was 32806 milliseconds.

For the third and final map, after first joining it, I calculated a frame rate of 13 per second, and an elapsed time of 32269 milliseconds between frame update, averaged over a minute. After joining it a second time, the frame rate was 18, and the elapsed time was 26956 milliseconds per minute.

Per second, all of these maps and sessions had a minimum of 500 milliseconds between frames every second, and a maximum of 700 milliseconds between frames.

Again, as stated: this update can be ignored as it was only made for this pull request. I do plan on adding a separate interface that shows this information, which will be accessed via button or key press.

- Each string line are messed up, i'd reorganized it by read it again from a top. ( it is also get helped by lasted changes from WilloIzCitron )
- The names for faction, turrets, cores and units is supposed to remain the same.  Example [ ""Baluarti""] are actually spanish
wanna havin fun with momok are probably best idea, but yea i presume the name was the part from April Fools ]
- Change ""armor"" into it's international word ""pelindung""
- Reposition some words that based on ( Butuh, Perlu, Tenaga, Daya, Barang, Benda, Sumber Daya, Bijih, Anda, Kamu, Target, Sasaran, Pipa, Saluran, Proyektor, Pangkalan, Pendaratan Musuh, Buat, Cipta, Distribusi, Penembak, Berlebih, Berkurang, Jumlah, Dapat, Dipindahkan, Memulihkan, Terlindungi, Peroleh, Darah, Proses Muatan, \ > atau, Suplai, Simpul, Memindahkan, Petak, Pengarah, and more !)
- Specific block with ""optional"" word = turn into ( Opsional ) at the end description.
- ""Fabricator and Refabricator"" word are now called ""Pabrikator dan Pabrikator Ulang""
- Arkycite Liquid are STILL being the unexisted thing. But i want to make sure to keep the name until there is more information of said Liquid in Real World.
- Rewrite the Description of sectors and blocks with the V7 Version. Note that i've seeing old translation from V5
- Subjects such as The Tutorial Stuff, some said probably get changes. But anyway, submit this for next Mindustry Patch. (i would appreciate that)"

As I have seen this in the [trello](https://trello.com/c/RVxtZEpU/929-new-landing-sound), I decided to give it a shot. The land music mostly resembles the old one, and added wind and rocket engine sounds. It sounds nice in my opinion, and doesn't stray far from the original music.

- if(fieldName.equals(""requestId"")) {

## Mod content load order
A big problem with every single hjson mod is that the order of content is always alphabetically sorted.
This forces mod makers to make json files have indexes in the content names, like `0001_`, `00_a-`, etc. to make them ordered correctly. This is very distracting, as bundles also need to account for such things, etc.

What this PR adds is a `config.(h)json` file in a content type folder for content type specific configuration. Currently, it can have a `contentOrder` array parameter to it, which allows modders to directly specify the order of content loading (and thus, the order of appearance in the build menu and core database) of the content type. The changes I made are completely backwards compatible, with mods not having configs having the same behaviour as before.

Both the config file and the `contentOrder` parameter are optional.

An example of a such parameter in `content/blocks/config.hjson`:
```
contentOrder: [
""sealedconveyor"", 
""armored-sealed-conveyor"", 
""sealedrouter"", 
""sealedsorter"", 
""sealed-overflow"", 
""sealed-unloader""
]
```

This makes it so content that is listed in the `contentOrder` will be queued in `runs` during mod content loading in the order specified.
If something is *not* listed in the `contentOrder`, then it will be loaded after the ordered content, sorted in the same way as before (alphabetically). This makes it backwards-compatible, as well the config file and `contentOrder` param optional.

## I tested:
* Multiple normal hjson mods - No effect at all to existing mods
* .hjson mod with a `contentOrder` in `content/blocks/config.hjson` - The contents were in the correct order in the core database / build menu as specified. Content that was not in `contentOrder` was placed after the ordered content, sorted alphabetically like previous behaviour.
* That same .hjson mod with the `contentOrder` configuration on latest stable build (146), loads without errors (so mods that *do* use it can be played on stable, but without the ordering)

This simple change could really help modders (especially hjson) with custom factories if the flame isn't locked in the center and could be offsetted (like turrets have shootX and shootY) though flameX and flameY.


Example of a hjson modded building that uses flameX = 6f and flameY = 6f:

What it would look like if accepted.

## Things that may cause this PR to be not accepted:
1) If `doInit` is changed to false, so the server name bar doesn't appear if servers are offline, there is strange behavior when there are more than 1 sever in a server group.
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/146392884/eb96bd49-11b4-4ced-9df4-e0a4a541d3ba)
Works fine if there is only 1 server, or if `doInit` is true.

2) There is no tool-tip describing what the star button does (for accessibility?)

- Added rule search in custom map rules dialog
- Added info buttons for some rules (basically a must have thing for mods adding new rules, but even some vanilla rules should have a better explanation than just a title)

More complicated stuff: rules in separate ""categories"" (previously they were simply divided by accent color titles) now belong to different tables. This way, titles only appear when there's at least one rule in category during search.

Also, the basic methods for adding new rules are now public (hope it is fine), and `setup()` runs all the stuff in `Seq<Runnable> additionalSetup` before adding category tables to dialog. Combined with having separate category tables for rules, these changes make adding new rules through modding way easier.

1784510173,ItemDurationMultiplier Implementation and Phase RTG Adjustment,SomeonesShade,2024-03-21 13:25:06+00:00,2025-02-08 05:08:07+00:00,{},"### Implemented Item Duration Multipliers as another dial to balance Consume Generators.
*As there is coupling with the item properties and power output, this is a way to adjust it properly as showcased with rtg phase. Buffing it to high radioactive properties just to balance one block is too tightly coupled to work with.*
*Also, Mods can also now balance different power blocks using the same item affinity being used, really great!*

#### Demo: [OUTDATED]

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2c55ab5-4d70-42e7-a3ad-6012763d49e6

*Stats shown are only for demo... except for phase RTG*

### Buffed RTG Phase to give it a unique and useful dynamic against thorium,
*I was deciding if I should make a dedicated suggestion post for it, but for now this will suffice*

#### Reason: 
- It is pretty terrible. Consumes 4 thorium and 10 sand, for 60% power output.
- Now instead of having a bad performing item that doesn't add much to the game...
- Making it viable and playing to how consume generators handle when there are multiple items... 
The player can have an underbelly of really ***item efficient but terrible tile/cost efficiency*** to be used in the lategame, while feeding in ***raw thorium ore for more power yield*** can be a really nice dynamic to work with.

#### Demo: [OUTDATED]

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f207dc4-470f-4427-8e3a-12e30fda0593


*Showcasing the two items' interplay and dynamics... 67 RTG* 

- Phase takes a long time before everything is fed to 10 items. 
- When it does, the logic allows to insert in thorium causing more power to be injected in by having excess thorium going in. 
- This causes the power to variate, increasing the overdomed phase RTGs to be above their expected (~27k power).
- Although with thor RTG being worse than Thorium Reactor in item efficiency...
The dynamic is that it acts as a thorium sink if you have excess thor but dont want to build new infrastructure, and phase RTG allows you to scale it by quite a lot.

#### Okay... why 210 seconds?

Math [Power Units / Item]: Item Efficiency
Thor RTG: `270 pu/sec * 14 sec / 1 item-thorium` = 3780 pu/item
Phase RTG: `(60%)*270 pu/sec * 210 sec / 4 item-thorium` = 8505 pu/item
Thorium Reactor:  `900 pu/sec * 6 sec / 1 item-thorium` = 5400 pu/item

The floor here is to make sure that at least Phase RTG is better than Thorium Reactor's pu/item-thor
Since Phase RTG costs a lot more (via fabricated materials) and has 10 sand to deal with... I'd say it's an okay number.
It can be reduced anyway easily if people do somehow get a good argument on why its broken.


### Extra Notes:

***Pyratite Steam?*** I think its fine for the lategame copper tech anyway, since it can never nor should be competitive with differential generator. Although others (or me if I change my mind) can advocate for a change.

(Blast Steam... yeah I tried but there is no way to make it work lol in concept. Massive water consumption is tackled with spore, pyra has high power/refined/coal efficient, and coal.... is the raw ore into power conversion. Blast has no place.)

Currently, there does exist a `Trigger.unitCommandAttack`, which is fired when the player gives units an attack command (i.e. there's an an enemy building at the coordinates, or the user clicked on an enemy unit instead of terrain when giving the command). There is also `Trigger.unitCommandChange`, which is fired whenever the user changes their command group (i.e. draws a new selection box, or selects all by type), but 

`Trigger.unitCommandPosition` (the new event) makes it possible to make listeners for whenever a movement command is issued to a group of units.

In the description of core unit operations, the original translation used the phrase `（默认使用[拾取，]放下载荷）` which, although it implied the information about shortcut keys, might not be intuitive or easy to understand for players.

Therefore, I have modified it to a more explicit expression: `（默认使用快捷键“[”拾取载荷，“]”放下载荷）` Such a change is aimed at making the game's operational instructions clearer, especially for beginners."

- Alpha with warmup before drawing the plate region. Currently, it doesn't so it just appears when you shoot.
  - ...Wow it's my own mistake again. Apparently I did that. (#7751)

Additions/Changes:
- z is now default to -1
  - Why was it defaulted to effect anyway?
- Color now defaults to null. If null, uses team color.
- Can selectively decide whether to draw the plate and the shine.
- Plate and shine can now have different sprites.
  - `plateSuffix` and `shineSuffix`
    - ...Is customizable suffix even necessary?

- Made map locales dialog convert newlines to `\n` and vice-versa on property import/export.
- Translated 2 lines in `bundle_ru.properties`, which somehow remained untranslated from v7 release.
If this translation is fine, i will work on translating all the new features later.
- Changed outdated info about `@` placeholders in map bundles info dialog.
**However, i don't know if automatic bundle update changes this in other bundles too. If not, i will change it later.**

- Fixed incorrect calculation of columns amount in locale bundles dialog
- Replaced 8 in speed status effect fix with `Vars.tilesize`
- Map locale bundles import/export now supports escaping `\n`

Teams can now have flags assigned to them, which allow granular control over what a team can or can't do.

~~A bleeding edge (bypassing commits) unversioned desktop build for this PR can be found [here](http://2.baseduser.eu.org/Mindustry.jar). I'm running these builds off of a bash script for every change I make in the code.~~

## Breaking changes
Mods will no longer be able to rely on pure `self.team != other.team` checks for enemy checks, these checks are now only useful for pure-team checks and UI. `Team#isEnemy` has been undeprecated.

## Known issues (don't comment these)
* No map serialization
* ~~No team flag initialization (run `for(i=0;i<256;i++){Team.all[i].flags[0]=TeamFlags.derelictTarget;Team.all[i].flags[i]=TeamFlags.genericSelf}` manually)~~
* Indexers and quadtrees are messed up because they use `int` internally and have no `Team` comparisons/return generic team matches intentionally
* No `null` checks in the vast majority of method invocations, causing a copious amount of `NullPointer`s (do comment where it *can* crash, though)
* ~~Build radius check is on `isNeutral`, not `ignoresBuildRadius`~~
* `Weaponc` entities can kill themselves
* Non-sharded teams, for whatever reason, cannot control all of their units
* Fog is literally unchanged

As if it wasn't clear enough, ***this PR is not finished.*** I also have no idea what effects it has on performance, but since I haven't intimately looked at indexers, quadtrees and AI yet I believe there aren't any adverse effects (until I change them to match)

I was going through some java packages on Nixpkgs to see if they were completely deterministic, and if not, fix them.

This package only had a few issues with determinism: one of them I could figure out, and is fixed in this PR, the other one is probably any issue inside `Arc`.

---

The first issue was that `file.list()` or `file.listFiles()` gives back files in a non-fixed order (at least on Linux), so the generated files would differ between builds.

This PR fixes this by running `.sort()` before processing the file names.
I also refactored the code to use `list` instead of `listFiles`.


---

The other issue mentioned above is an issue, where the spritesheets inside `core/assets/sprites` are in a (maybe) random order.
[link to the relevant code](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/92b2fc077254dfc3dc649a3b742013e5e2e4391b/tools/build.gradle#L174C9-L186)

Sadly, as I am not really familiar with the codebase of `Arc` I couldn't figure out whether the issue was with the file iteration of the used FileProcessor or the packing algorithm

Should I open this last part as an issue on `Arc`?"

# Changes:
1. Texture markers (able to draw any single texture from the game, limitless)
2. Markers now support drawing on different z layers (marker rendering moved from `OverlayRenderer.drawTop()` to `Renderer.draw()`)
3. Added minimap mode to other markers (default minimap marker just ignores this value), added autoscale option for markers.
4. `null` values now make marker control methods use previous values instead of converting `null` to 0 (small changes in `LExecutor`, `MapObjectives`), removed redundant marker control operations.
5. Minor locale bundles dialog fixes.
6. Added color pickers to some logic instruction where it's useful (new `col()` method in `LStatement`).
7. Swap 1st and 2nd argument in `makemarker` for argument consistency (usually a dropdown option comes before all the other args, and this kind of consistency is important for editing mlog code as text).

Hey. First of all, thank you for a great game.

Currently on desktop when the player puts a BuildPlan and then clicks that plan, the plan becomes moved and creates a ""shivering"" effect: you didn't mean to move it, but it moved.
My PR addresses just this tiny annoyance.

Change list:
1. Added two new world processor instructions:
- `Format` (replacing placeholders in text buffer)
- `Print Locale (privileged)` (printing locale bundles properties to text buffer using current player's selected locale (prints ???propertyname??? on server)).
2. Added `MapLocales` class to `mindustry.type` and i'm still not sure if it should be there.
3. Made map objectives and objective markers text use locale bundles properties whenever possible.
4. Made new dialog in `Map Editor > Map Info` for setting map locale bundles. Supports copying and pasting bundles as text.
5. Made map locale bundles support displaying mobile tips (searches for properties with names ending in "".mobile."" first if you are on mobile device), but still added `@clientMobile` global var, may be useful too

## Details About Security Recommendation -  From: [Pixeebot](https://www.pixee.ai/)
* This change updates all new instances of [ZipInputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/zip/ZipInputStream.html) to protect against malicious entries that attempt to escape their ""file root"" and overwrite other files on the running filesystem.

Normally, when you're using `ZipInputStream` it's because you're processing zip files. That code might look like this:

```java
File file = new File(unzipTargetDirectory, zipEntry.getName()); // use file name from zip entry
InputStream is = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry); // get the contents of the zip entry
IOUtils.copy(is, new FileOutputStream(file)); // write the contents to the provided file name
```

This looks fine when it encounters a normal zip entry within a zip file, looking something like this pseudo-data:
```binary
path: data/names.txt
contents: Zeus\nHelen\nLeda...
```

However, there's nothing to prevent an attacker from sending an evil entry in the zip that looks more like this:
```binary
path: ../../../../../etc/passwd
contents: root::0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
```

Yes, in the above code, which looks like [every](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23870468) [piece](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51285801) of [zip-processing](https://kodejava.org/how-do-i-decompress-a-zip-file-using-zipinputstream/)  code you can [find](https://www.tabnine.com/code/java/classes/java.util.zip.ZipInputStream) on the [Internet](https://www.baeldung.com/java-compress-and-uncompress), attackers could overwrite any files to which the application has access. This rule replaces the standard `ZipInputStream` with a hardened subclass which prevents access to entry paths that attempt to traverse directories above the current directory (which no normal zip file should ever do.) Our changes end up looking something like this:

```diff
+ import io.github.pixee.security.ZipSecurity;
  ...
- var zip = new ZipInputStream(is, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
+ var zip = ZipSecurity.createHardenedInputStream(is, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

3. Fix marker type selection table in Create Marker instruction not remembering which marker type was set before: one code line was comparing marker type strings with ==, so i replaced it with .equals(). I think this one shouldn't break other value comparsions, yes?

1. Add wproc-controlled markers sequence (`IntMap`) to `Rules` (each marker has its own identifier)
2. New `Marker` instruction for world processors
3. Add `hidden` boolean and some controlling methods to `ObjectiveMarker` for use in world processors
4. Add new `LineMarker` to objective markers
5. `ObjectiveMarker` writer/reader methods in `TypeIO`, new `@Remote setMarker()` method

P.S: New `TypeIO` methods read/write a single marker data, not the whole sequence. And the whole markers sequence isn't being synced except server's `Rules` sync. This is probably more optimized and creates an opportunity to desync markers between server and clients (for example, this is really useful for displaying different markers text depending on player's selected locale).
_This is my first PR ever, so i could have screwed up anywhere in the code, even though i tested these features on both client and local server as much as i could_

This PR increases the sync rate from 10 times per second (100ms) to 66.6 times per second (15ms).

# why

You might want to sync some things a lot faster for precision (or other networking-related) reasons. However, there's no real point to synchronize anything faster than once every tick, because the vast majority of Mindustry players run at 60 FPS, and synchronizing a variable faster than that is wasteful. It also isn't a multiple-orders-of-magnitude level increase, your code would have to intentionally be bad (from a mapper PoV) in order for problems to occur.

I chose 15ms because it allows some more leeway with frametimes.

# what's the worst that can happen

Bandwidth might increase up to 6x for badly written code. Not really within crashing limits, but still probably on the same importance as `setblock` and `explosion` spam (tested just now on a statistically average client-server pair)

Hello, regarding the recent series of events, I would like to clarify. As for the ""personal attack in the server description"" issue, it was due to a recent massive wave of bot attacks on the community server, and many of these bots had names related to the mentioned subject. The use of such a terrible name in the description was only meant to refer to this particular attack, which ultimately led to the removal of the community server. I believe this is a misunderstanding. I have already changed the server description, and I genuinely hope for understanding regarding my mistake and for the server to be reinstated. Thank you.

So according to [rules](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/master/SERVERLIST.md):

> 3. **Set an appropriate MOTD, name and description.** This is set with `config <name/desc/motd> <value>`. ""Appropriate"" means that:
    Your name or description must reflect the type of server you're hosting. 
   Since new players may be exposed to the server list early on, put in a phrase like ""Co-op survival"" or ""PvP"" so players know what they're getting into. Yes, this is also displayed in the server mode info text, but having extra info in the name doesn't hurt.
    Make sure players know where to refer to for server support. It should be fairly clear that the server owner is not me, but you.
    **Try to be professional** in your text; use common sense.

But this server broke the rules by slandering others reputation:

- Just bought a game, immediately liked it. 
- However on fullscreen of macbooks with notches on screen, HUDFragment appears below the notch (so, basically, invisible). 
- I found [another guy who struggles with it](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1127400/discussions/0/3843304884854109789/).
- Initial idea was to make a mod, but after inspecting game code, I think it's impossible to adjust interface with mods.
- Sorry, this is the first time I edit Java code.
- Height of notch is 32 points. 
- This PR works for me with one critical exception: I didn't find a way to re-initialize UI after settings changed.

Added a search message text to the search bar, and make the buttons overlay-ed.

![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/479b71d4-aa33-4a56-8dff-b684f2be781e)

Changed the styles of these buttons so they won't show ugly square around the icon when you click it.
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/e5ddfd3c-c8d1-4fa7-96ba-038fec050268)

Also improved the edit tags dialog, to make it more fancy and organized, now with 4 buttons (and probably just that, well because there is not enough place to put another button right now)
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/85106900-824c-4276-896c-9a9bd88b265d)


Added Export and Edit button into the info dialog of the schematic, so you can export or edit right away when you save a schematic.
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/e0040cf1-1bbc-4274-a611-85b9e17390b2)

also renamed the ""rename schematic"" to edit schematic, to better reflect what it does (and also resized the save and cancel button)
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/cd64c9a9-d92d-49ac-85c6-092ff8ca052f)

Added icons to icon tags, I dunno why this doesn't existed in the first place but it's here now.
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/4462f472-a925-4568-b020-519b7359c11e)

On to the map load dialog, this one is smaller than the schems one, but it sure does change a lot.
Make use of the `makeButtonOverlay()`, changes button width and style, pretty much changes everything I guess (still looks the same.)
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/3d106e66-b810-4341-86c8-3264aed9200d)

lastly, correctly adjusted the width of the search bar of the content selection.
![image](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/assets/85090668/d90f18b7-783c-4d57-8092-a84cf2e19bc9)

I should also mention that https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/4443 is a very interesting suggestion to consider, but right now I don't know how to approach it.

###### I should stop doing UIs somehow, but these things don't break anyone's game when something gone wrong sooo

    - `UnitTypes.disrupt.weapons.first().bullet.spawnUnit.weapons.first().bullet = UnitTypes.quell.weapons.first().bullet`
    - Spawned units follow the original disrupt's aim.
  - [X] Case 2: Missile unit's weapon's bullet's frags produce missile units.
    - `UnitTypes.disrupt.weapons.first().bullet.spawnUnit.weapons.first().bullet.fragBullet = UnitTypes.quell.weapons.first().bullet`
    - Spawned units do not follow the original disrupt's aim, but also do not track towards 0, 0 anymore.
      - Since the bullet's owner is the missile, it then passes that missile down through its frags as the next missile's shooter, however since I made `MissileAI` not rotate towards aim pos if the shooter is dead, the missiles do not track toward 0, 0. Just make the weapon shoot multiple missiles instead of using frag.

0 to disable (wave goes indefinitely), 1 to make your game win instantly (why?)
If the wave has reached the limit (say wave 30/30) and the enemy units have been cleared, game over menu will pop up.

Also rearranged wave sending and wave timer so the rules look more clean when wave timer is disabled, and make everything disabled when waves rule is off.

NOTE: how would wave limit in PvP works? since the winning team will always be the `defaultTeam`.

Added search bar for wave info UI, a filter next to it because it feels too empty without one, and probably fixed other editor UI things.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230944729-a29ca15a-921e-412f-9bf3-1b4b989841bd.mp4

Type a number, and the graph on the right will shift to the number inputted, the wave group on the left will change to only show the unit that will spawn in the wave that is the number you inputted too.

The filter icon next to the search bar, when clicked, will show a selection of units to choose, and that unit will be the unit the wave group pane will only show.
###### Apparently in the old PR, I have overcomplicated it, it was a big hassle and no one would use it anyways so stick to only the useful ones for now.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230947194-6c517056-30cc-41ea-8577-43f7ef797da6.png)

Moving on to one of the smaller things, moved the filter button to be next to the add button ~~exactly like the old PR.~~

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230947404-0f7e1daf-813b-4cba-89b7-fedfba8e8ea1.png)

Reordered and resized this edit dialog to be consistent with the generation ones ~~and the next target is the logic one.~~

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230948423-d865ea6b-0fa0-4377-a48b-4da4ce921f77.png)

Okay and great tooltips everywhere in case it isn't obvious enough ~~and make use of the `<none>` now that there is `<none found>` replacing almost all of its uses~~

And probably several internal things I could not care less to mention about it because apparently people wants to only see interesting things and not uninteresting things

Oh and maybe I should mentions some editor UI things too small to be a separate Pull Request ~~and as well name it random UI shit~~, so I might as well use the old PR tactic of sticking smaller changes with a big UI changes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230950048-f1973f2b-31ff-49bc-b4cf-fb88cebdb5e1.png)

Updated one of the most hidden dialog, to a new flat UI.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230950590-96eb438b-6a12-4bb1-8371-0e54e6eca7b4.png)

extended the search bar of the editor, so more words can be shown, and it looks better that way.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/230950502-b2ed1b5c-169a-4e84-b279-5d6ff292ba2c.png)

so added a search icon to search bar, so that they searchingly searches for the search that you have searched for correctly.

Okay that's it, I should write less in an otherwise self-explanatory PR sometimes, might as well be just a video and some texts next time, people in general are not so keen at reading more than eight sentences.

1298645885,Fixing Call.menu() not hiding on option selection.,Xasmedy,2023-04-01 09:57:21+00:00,2023-04-01 13:54:01+00:00,{},"*When 3 hours of testing gets thrown in the garbage by a single refactoring...*

I was calling `UI.hide()` instead of `Dialog.hide()`, now fixed.

**Tests ran before this PR**
- (Menu) if closeOnBack gets called.
- (Menu) if the buttonListener get called + if it has the correct option.
- (Menu) if hidden after the option selection.
- (FollowUpMenu) if closeOnBack gets called.
- (FollowUpMenu) if the button listener gets called + if it has the correct option.

I went with `Cons2<Integer, Dialog>` ([to replace](https://github.com/Anuken/Arc/pull/141)) instead of having a `boolean hideMenu` to allow easier maintenance (if ever needed) in the future.
(*Stupid example that gives the point: hiding the menu with no delay when `option = -2`.*)

Currently, unit.spawnedByCore is not set correctly in UnitChangeEvent.
This is because the function that fires it (`unit.controller(player)`) does not seem to run any important code, but it actually runs player.unit(unit) which fires the event.
This was easily fixed by setting spawnedByCore first.

(Really weird edge case but it does matter, see [this plugin](https://github.com/BalaM314/fish-commands/blob/e8dc73303feed633ead3bd190f60fea924aa8bc1/scripts/players.ts#L123))

- Batteries now use a drawer
- `warmup()` on batteries is now the power status
- Added `DrawPower`
  - 3 ways to draw power
    - If no sprite is given, it draws a full square like how batteries did.
    - If a sprite is given, it draws that sprite with the proper color.
    - If `mixcol` is false,  then it lerps between an `-empty` and `-full` sprite instead of coloring.

this feature is used to make the units move directly to the target as what the ""move"" in the logic processor does. it's useful when i command my units without logic processors, especially in Erekir. for example, there's no easy way to command locus to cross a slag river but control them one by one. another example is that when i need clerois go up to the cliff, they take a long way around but not to cross the cliff directly. with this feature, these problem will be solved."

## Scenario 

I just started playing this game, I absolutely love it. However, I am a very busy college student who goes from computer to computer. I wanted to save my game data without exporting and importing it. I carry the game around on a USB. in my Pull request I added the ability for the game to scan for a folder called `gameData` and use that instead of the default %appdata% in windows. I also did not want to keep settings the env variable. I have only been coding in java off and on as the semesters have required me, so my code may be a bit noobish. I hope this is a useful addition or at least the gateway to future development on this functionality. "

1212652741,Removal of OmniDustry from servers_v7.json,Volas171,2023-01-22 16:24:02+00:00,2023-02-25 18:34:04+00:00,{},"# The time has come.
It has been brought to my attention that this server encourages NSFW and similar which is clearly stated in SERVERLIST.md as something that would remove a server immediately. 

## 1) Lack of moderation:
No one punishes players who engage in griefing, insulting, or building NSFW art. Why? Because there are very few admins on this server, and those that do exist are constantly inactive. Reports and appeals on this server are almost never considered; if they even considered adding an anti-griefing plugin, they have not.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60143910/213926091-1aaf41c5-5ea7-4a21-9bfa-c4e3437b78ec.png)
Members have Innapropiate symbols and admins doing nothing
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60143910/213926699-c3874a06-95ff-4998-a3ca-7b05fbeba4f5.png)
Owner ignores the fact there's a clear griefing problem
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60143910/213926837-dabb5fa9-1499-478c-8f9a-f24e15df3733.png)

## 2) Very toxic community:
While playing on this server, I constantly encountered toxicity, swearing, and insults from other players, and this was not only me, a lot of people reported this happening.

## 3) The Owner Steals Maps:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60143910/213926007-c0f4b1b6-a1c5-47e7-a3ec-9bb7c5463ed1.png)
While this may seem like something that does not matter, the author of the map in question requested the owner to remove it and the owner seems to have done nothing about it.

## 4) Community Opinion
Almost anywhere you ask, people will tell you the omnidustry player base is sh*t and that their server is a ""p*rn site""
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60143910/213926172-a4d31100-1323-4c59-919f-d676b4866f1e.png)

Investigating this, I also realized [a YouTuber named Gwapo made a video about OmniDustry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSaJYdsr6kE)

## 5) The NSFW problem
Apparently, their servers have an NSFW problem that they have solved ""by removing logic blocks""
even after they have done this, you can still find swastikas, big sorter penises, and more,
we sent a team of investigators to check whatever was going on in that server and they came back with surprising images of the same logic staying for 5 days unchanged or anything by the moderators

## 6) Owner literally passes his own rules trough his ass.
As comedic as it might sound, he literally ripped off his rules from easyplay.su, and when he realized his moderators were not complying the rules, he just changed the rules

At the extreme, even if a modified client shows up and hides the list of mods being sent to the server, it's better than a server that has no idea what hidden mods the client is installing and making the game unfair.
It's common to use hidden mods to unlock blueprint bans and server rate limiters. (rip arc packet spam detector)

1209432383,Adds control groups,Garen7,2023-01-19 03:35:15+00:00,2023-09-20 03:50:09+00:00,{},"Adds the following controls for doing control groups

- Create Control Group (Ctrl+Num)
- Add to Control Group (Unset)
- Create Auto Control Group (Alt+Num)
- Focus Cam on Control Group (Double Tap Num)

The add to control group button is unset by default since that would normally go on the left shift key however that spot is currently taken and I don't want to cause confusion. I have also added a setting that will cause control groups to automatically remove the units you add to them from the other groups as that is usually the preferred way of doing it but sometimes you see games do it the other way, or offer both as an option.

2 Problems I want to mention however:
1. ~~If you sync the non auto control groups will disappear, I could maybe fix this by using the units id instead of a reference to the unit(not sure if I can do this actually or if its worth it)~~
2. When you focus the camera on the control group it will not use the smooth camera if that setting is enabled(I couldn't use Core.camera.position.lerpDelta since the focus camera thing only runs on one update tick, I could instead make it follow the group and it would be fine but I wanted to verify if that's preferred before actually adding that since it would be more code and less standard for control group stuff)

But yeah please let me know if you want me to try doing the potential fixes I mentioned or if theres a smarter way of doing that instead

This is a bug fixed.
This affects multiplayer and singleplayer.
I first encountered it on 2r2t.
This is caused by a `NullPointerException`.
Explanation is in comments just in case someone else ever encounters it and gets confused.

Replicating this bug is easy:
1. Have this configuration. Note that the hyperproc is binded to the router.
    ![Screenshot_2022-12-26-22-46-27-23_13f989b68d7412e5a177fb13b36ac66f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68312688/209565127-d158ea16-e319-44c7-8380-99d0969f7133.jpg)
2. Copy this code to the logic processor:
    ```
    control config router1 0 0 0 0
    control config router1 1 0 0 0
    ```
3. Wait for some time."

Note: Currently only applies to units being removed, not blocks like payload conveyors. I'm sure there's a better solution for this problem, which is why I'm not immediately changing all of the blocks. I'm also not applying to all blocks that store actual payloads because it has to account for unit payloads dumping.

The use cases are below:

-Vent condensers can be built over turbine condensers and vice versa
-Duct unloaders and electrolyzers can be built over themselves for easier rotating
-Payload conveyors no longer assume you want to erase normal conveyors you're building over
-Payload blocks like loaders and unloaders can be built over Payload conveyors

From what I can tell the only other place block groups are used besides building over blocks is for the SuicideAI that crawlers have, however that doesn't matter for vent/turbine condensers and duct unloaders since they're on Erekir. Though payload conveyors can now be targeted but afaik that shouldn't be an issue.

as far as we knew, they were using the following ip's:
20.228.150.178
20.242.52.106
20.237.254.138
prettymuch the entire /8 20.0.0.0 block
and some others like 172.173.xxx

At this point we knew the attackers were using Microsoft Azure, then [a fancy message was sent on the mindustry discord](https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/402527137229438996/1043877347608252456)

One thing we did notice was that easyplay.su nor darkdustry was being attacked, they were the only servers to be empty from bots, this was really suspicious, shortly after that message was sent, the attack stopped and the bots switched to numbers
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60143910/203157460-22e76b48-accb-4f2a-a873-e9a4e7bbae74.png)

Darkness (darkdustry owner) admitted to trying to ddos the servers and helping with the bots (mentions names).


Now, this is truly not enough proof, but with the help of other servers, I'm sure this is pretty clear.
_Such servers shall be removed from the list due to committing felony acts (like dosing servers) or just making the community have a worse time so they check their servers for their own advantage, but well, it's up to Anuke._

- Fixed a bug where the mod initialization order is not guaranteed to be kept after the initial resolution.

From some basic testing it works fine and making a regular drill is identical to before, but for some _strange_ reason the draw order gets screwed during construction.

I also removed the burst drill inverting because it would have left stray values or hardcoded drawing and it's used so little that _even the base game does it just half the time._

Note that unlike the Pick block hotkey this does not change the category on the block selector panel since afaik there isn't a nice way to do that without being in the PlacementFragment class, not sure if that's a deal breaker but I didn't notice any bugs as a result of that.

Since the pull request got accepted, it is necessary to copy the changes from Arc's `autoFixed(value, maxPrecision)` to Mindustry's `fixValue(value)` to make sure a correct precision is used.

The two methods were practically the same, so I replaced all occurrences of `fixValue()` with `autoFixed()` and made `fixValue()` deprecated. As far as I know `fixValue()` was used only in the StatValues class and nowhere else (not even some mods I briefly checked). I was tempted to delete it altogether, but decided to deprecate it instead since it is a public method.

I managed to find only 2 stats that were not displayed properly before the fix: Precept's speed (4.80 -> 4.8) and healing from Overdrive status (0.60 -> 0.6).

1085265256,Expand getBlock functionality,FlippingPotatoes,2022-10-12 22:02:49+00:00,2022-10-13 14:13:17+00:00,{},"Let's the player use getBlock to detect water, floor, and ore tiles.

A reimagining of pr #6956, but now it doesn't break old logic, and still adds the majority of its function.

~~Simply adds a boolean input to getBlock (in the same fashion as unitLocate's enemy boolean) that lets you choose to search for floor tiles instead of block tiles.~~ When used and a non-air overlay tile is present (ie. ores) it will default 'floor' to that, otherwise it will return the floor tile in 'floor'.

The main goal here was being able to make cool logic-based maps, detect water to allow (shitty) pathfinding, and have a more precise method of detecting ores.

Tested to make sure old logics are unchanged on this branch (simply because you already have 5 variables for unitControl thanks to build, all the considered problems are already solved)

Also changed the bundle description of getBlock to reflect this.

~~clearly me waiting two months to try this again was optimal, just attempting to squeeze this into v7~~

This game played in a variety of devices, some of them are high-end PCs, lap-top or tablets with big screen size. 
Unfortunately the current settings won't allow you to use this advantage and make your screen fit as many of view as your device can process.

For convenience, the quit button is always kept in the bottom right / bottom part of the menu, so the custom buttons are inserted between it and other buttons.

MenuFragment.Buttoni was made public and is now used to store the registered ""button definitions""... I'm not sure if this is the best approach, but it works.

I'm not sure if this is too significant a change to make, but having it consistent with the constructor would be nice, so I thought I'd make it easy to change if you wanted to.

I split this up into 2 commits to avoid it looking like the 'normal' deconstructor being shrunk - depending on how important this is and whether or not it gets merged squashing may or may not be worth it.

I also updated the bundle entries in all languages manually because `updateBundles` made a slight mess of it - I assume it's not made to deal with renames. The translations themselves would have to be updated by the translators though.

  - `mul` now checks for ""amount"" similarly to `add`
  - `sin` checks for ""offset"", and inputs it if it exists. Otherwise 0 is input for the offset
  - `curve` now checks for ""interp"" similarly to `add`
- Added `compress`
  - Uses `Mathf.curve`, so you could make something that starts with a delay and ends early without having to use `delay` and `shorten` together and calculate what the amount put into `shorten` should be because `delay` already is shortening the time span blah blah
  - I don't know if ""compress"" is the best name for the op but it's what I came up with.

Implements [suggestion #3760](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/3760).

Heat Routers split heat into three directions. They accept heat from any direction, but a redirector heating its sides doesn't work due to heat cycles (just like a circle of redirectors).

Currently, this reuses the redirector sprites, and has the same icon, since heat outputs don't appear on icons.

**In a nutshell:**
- They work on a reduced list of surrounding buildings (updated with onProximityUpdate) to filter out the blocks they can never interact with (examples: wall, power node, water extractor...).
This avoids wasting time calculating the stats for something that never gets used, and allows for saving the block list and avoids recreating it everytime unloaders update.
- Multiple tiny optimisations everywhere, deleted unused bits, and merged the null/set item behaviors into a single method for better consistency and readability

I don't mean to be annoying by constantly opening a new PR as the old one is merged, just want to ensure there's a translation for newish features available.

To my fellow translators @end-me-please and @Shawak - I saw the Serpulo sector names and personally think it would be better to either find a translation for all of them or to leave them all English, not a half-half as we have now. I'd suggest the below (not committed yet), do you have any thoughts / things you would change?

I'm unsure about Ground Zero and Impact 0078, they seem like terminology / names as opposed to the other more descriptive names so I've left them as they were for now.
```
sector.impact0078.name = Impact 0078
sector.groundZero.name = Ground Zero
sector.craters.name = Die Krater
sector.frozenForest.name = Gefrorener Wald
sector.ruinousShores.name = Trümmerstrände
sector.stainedMountains.name = Geflecktes Gebirge
sector.desolateRift.name = Einsame Kluft
sector.nuclearComplex.name = Kernherstellungskomplex
sector.overgrowth.name = Überwucherung
sector.tarFields.name = Teerfelder
sector.saltFlats.name = Salzebenen
sector.fungalPass.name = Infizierter Gebirgspass
sector.biomassFacility.name = Biomassensyntheselabor
sector.windsweptIslands.name = Windgepeitschte Inseln
sector.extractionOutpost.name = Extraktionsaußenposten
sector.planetaryTerminal.name = Planetares Launchterminal
sector.coastline.name = Küstenlinie
sector.navalFortress.name = Wasserfestung

mindustry has been completely rewritten from jva (vo🤮mit) into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🚀. this ensures Fearless Concurrency, as well as Blazing Fast. It also takes advantage of Rich Type System and Ownership Model Guarantee Memory-Safety (never crashes).
compile with `rustc mindustry.rs` (much easier than using gr*dle and other nonsense)
required dependencies:
- Mindustry.jar (put it into the working directory, idk why this is still required, must be a bug (I used unsafe{}))

954817851,Merge functionality of getBlockI into unit getBlock,FlippingPotatoes,2022-06-01 20:33:10+00:00,2022-09-02 01:11:06+00:00,{},"Makes the old unit control getBlock have the same output options as the new getBlock for world logic (though of course with the same range restrictions as before) caveat being it outputs to one variable instead of two and uses an input of 0-3 to change its modes similarly to radar changing its order.

This lets players access floor and ore tile types and lets them read all wall tile types. It also makes ""@ solid"" redundant (you can still reach the same functionality of detecting ""@ solid"" by determining if it's a block without any related building, ie. all walls and cliffs will have a block type but no building)

Unlike in #5811, a similar pr, floor tiles and such have already been made into variables (for the new world processors) so we can actually compare things and make simple example pieces of logic like this:

![getBlock Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75582921/171495354-83d67969-31f5-472f-800a-41e31856bf0b.png)

(the logic basically just grabs the tiles in the copper square and draws them)

Achievement menu:
completed achievements are being highlighted
you can search by name or description
textures are missing

Toast pop-up of a completed achievement (also missing textures)

Notes :
The Steam version keeps the exclusivity of achievement and player stats, including achievement progression. (rarity of achievements, etc)

This in-game achievement menu should work on Steam versions too (not the progression though)
Adding achievements through mods should also add them in the menu

In the future :
You can easily make a mobile version of this but i dont know how to use the GooglePlay nor AppleStore API.
I plan to add a lot more achievements (150+) to the game.

A check for ""is waiting for next wave"" and admin check and server/client check is in place.
If you feel a check is missing, feel free to contribute it.

```

            if(net.client() && player.admin && logic.canSkipWave()){

Also, I moved `canSkipWave` from private `HudSegment` as public boolean in `Logic`, so it is accessible from HudSegment and DesktopInput to reduce code duplicates.
The key to skip a wave is f9. Feel free to suggest another default key.

This PR makes it so that the keybindings for selecting buildings generated per planet, so for example a beam node would be [5, 1] instead of [5, 1, 6]. I opened this PR since I don't think anyone will go through the effort to memorize a 3 button input

For the code I see 13 lines below it says ""TODO this hides env unsupported blocks, not always a good thing"" so I'm not sure what the stance on this is. Also I'm just changing the getByCategory() method instead of making a new method since getByCategory() is used only for building keybinding generation"

935972502,german erekir & v7 translation,Catchears,2022-05-13 14:05:26+00:00,2022-07-15 03:33:26+00:00,{},"Original PR text below.
Is ready to merge whenever Erekir is ready for translations, but will be kept up to date until then.


Original text:
Cleans up missing translation. Leaving as draft for now as Erekir is not done and missing some bundle entries (e.g. the tutorial) and because there are some things I'm not quite sure about yet.

Ich habe ein Paar der neuen Übersetzungen (von @end-me-please) geändert, damit die anderen Namen besser passen, das wären:

- Gelber Stein -> Gelbstein
- Roter Stein -> Rotstein
- Berylliumhaltiger Stein -> Berylliumstein
- Rotes Eis -> Roteis

Diese Übersetzungen sind zwar vielleicht nicht ganz richtig, aber es sollte sich jeder denken können, was gemeint ist, und sie passen bei Sachen wie ""Gelbsteinschlot"" meiner Meinung nach einfach besser.

Mir fehlen jedoch Ideen für viele der neuen Einheiten und Geschösse:
block.breach.name = Breach
block.sublimate.name = Sublimate
block.diffuse.name = Diffuse
unit.vanquish.name = Vanquish
unit.conquer.name = Conquer
unit.avert.name = Avert
unit.disrupt.name = Disrupt
unit.evoke.name = Evoke
unit.incite.name = Incite
unit.emanate.name = Emanate
unit.elude.name = Elude
unit.obviate.name = Obviate

Einfach die Infinitivformen im Deutschen zu nehmen ergibt keine vernünftigen Namen (Durchbrechen, Stören). Fällt vielleicht einem anderen Übersetzer etwas ein?"

Some of the main noteworthy changes:
- Finally decided to use ""Esquemas"" for ""Schematics"", instead of ""Plantillas"". (There are a few diferent words to use for this concept but wasn't sure wich one would fit better.)
- Conduit-related elements should use ""Tubería"", besides ""Conducto"" is more appropiate for ""Duct"" elements (wich are called ""Túnel"" to easily distinguish them.)
- Correctly conjugated verbs and reduced use of uppercases on common words to maintain correct spelling on as many strings as possible.
- Greatly improved the requirements needed to unlock new main sectors.
- Included a few more separate untranslated strings.
- Slightly improved the name of some main sectors in Serpulo.
- And many more little changes.

(Also updated my contributor name to match my GitHub username. Thanks for the attention <3)."

- unit - ""기체""로 통일 
- biomass - 포자의 목적을 고려하여 ( 전력 생산의 원료) ""생물자원""으로 번역
- at enemy - ""~을 향해""로 통일. 예외 : 호라이즌과 쿼드는 현재 위치에 탄환을 투하하므로 ""~에""로 작성함.
- 이 외에도 같은 문장이지만 다른 의미로 해석된 문단 통일

* 불필요한 설명 삭제 및 간소화
- 자원 : 추후 추가적인 번역 수정이 필요함.
- 번역 원문에 없는 부가적인, 굳이 필요하지 않는 설명 삭제
- 직역 지향

*  details에서 커뮤니티 밈 혹은 개드립 삭제
- 특정 커뮤니티에 속하지 않은 유저의 시선에서 보았을 때, 이해하기 힘든 문구들 삭제 
- 게임과 관련된, 유용한 팁을 추가하는 것이 여러모로 좋을 것 같음. 추후 수정 필요.

* Unify and change terms
- medium: Change the long word to ""보통"" which means something similar
- Unit - Unify as ""기체""
- Biomass - Translated as ""생물자원"" (raw material for power production) considering the purpose of spores
- at enemy - Unify as ""~을 향해"". Exception: Horizon and Quad drop bullets at their current location, so write ""~에""
- In addition to this, paragraph unification, which is interpreted in different ways in the same sentence

* Delete and simplify unnecessary comments
- Resources: Additional translation modifications are required later.
- Delete additional, unnecessary descriptions that are not in the original translation
- a literal orientation

* Delete a community meme or comment from details
- Delete phrases that are hard to understand when viewed from the perspective of users who do not belong to a particular community
- I think it would be good to add useful tips related to games in many ways. Need to be corrected later.

It is *painful* to read.

This PR:
 - Adds two utility methods, one to Player called `plainName()` that returns `Strings.stripColors(name)` and one to PlayerInfo called `plainLastName()` that does the same thing with `lastName`. 
 - Replaces all usage of the `Player.name` and `PlayerInfo.lastName` in console contexts (displaying and comparing in console commands) with the method variant for the stripped version.
 - Shows an `[A]` or `[P]` tag for the `players` and `status` command as an admin status indicator instead of a verbose boolean indicator. (image below)
 - Adds the uuid to the logs for admin actions so its easier to keep track. Player names are unreliable.
 - Displays both plain and raw names for trace info.
 - Various formatting fixes in the files changed because formatter did its thing.

- Renamed them to `ConsumePowerConditional` and `ConsumePowerDynamic` to be consistent with other consumes.
- Overrode `display()` in `ConsumePowerDynamic`, as it should be handled by the block, similarly to `ConsumeItemDynamic`

I know renaming stuff breaks things, but v7 private branch already breaks everything so this is nothing compared to that.

This PR update the showing of the reset key if it has been changed.
If the keybind is the same as the default key value, the reset button is not shown

There are two cases that can be implemented, but I choose the first because was making more sense.

The first: if all the keys are the default ones the reset button is not displayed and there is a gap in the actual missing button.
There is a blank space instead of Reset button.

The second: if all the keys are the default ones the reset button is not displayed and there is no gap in the actual missing button.

884045844,LiquidRouters - Loosen Throughput Reduction,hortiSquash,2022-03-19 20:57:49+00:00,2022-04-21 22:41:17+00:00,{},"temporary fix at best, but can improve the throughput by ~30% up to 4-5 routers in a row, and then go a tiny bit lower than with default scaling, but youre not supposed to have that many in a row anyways. 1.4-1.5 were good all rounders if you prefer. Didnt introduce bugs on my end, but i saw bugs when going lower like 1.01.

I mostly wanted to initiate the conversation about liquid routers. I want to fix them, and for real.
With no reduction (`scaling=1f`), its perfect, but backflow can make them hoard liquid that goes back and forth between two routers forever, and thats why you added that reduction by half, right?

I believe i can fix that if i modify `dumpLiquid()` to behave differently when outputting in the block it recieved liquid from the last. A solution i tried in here (using last block outputted into, so it keeps alternating and blinking cause its very bad), but the  speed is quite nice despite not being perfect (430-450/s compared to the full 500/s) (yes i dont play at 60fps) (and yes, it works less well at 60fps).

I am also proposing another solution: separate tanks/containers from routers, and remove all inventory from routers. And make them act like item gates or liquid junctions, just be a direct transfer. Which would have the side effect of trivializing cryo schematics for beginners, and reduce lag from anti-jam logic.

In a plugin, I want to write a more concise piece of code that relates to that specific unit AI, or to any property it has (team, for instance, but could also depend on type of weapons for ground units or anything else).

One special example is: I want base building team's AI's of daggers to make a formation before pathfinding to players' base, while this is unnessesary for players' daggers. Currenty it would take `if (unit.team == state.rules.waveTeam)` check on each update call and would only bloat the implementation of AI.

I have checked the implementation by replacing default controller for Monos and with NewHorizon mod which uses some custom AIs already. Any notes about `ContentParser.java` changes would be much appreciated.

first pr since a long while, but one that touches a long standing issue: each ip:port having their own usid.

if you admin people ingame while they are connected or by uuid manually it works just fine, but if you have multiple servers under your wing every (player &) admin will have a different usid on each server, which makes it quite ""hard"" to properly check/track player identity.

in the past there were some attempts (by others via pr here) at an account system or rsa/cryptographic verification instead of the usid system, this draft is a sort of compromise to achieve the same goal somewhat.

it will store an usid for each domain in the list added by this pr, and each server that uses a domain that starts with it (including subdomains) will share it, the usids are **not** shared between different domains on this list.

vanilla servers won't really benefit from this, but it will open up some opportunities for multi-server setups (via plugins):

- securely admin players via uuid & usid across all servers via e.g. a hub
- track player progress (stats? idk) more accurately by not having to rely on just username/ip/uuid
- being able to ""whitelist"" a server from the hub if they join e.g. a minigame server by whitelisting their uuid + usid & preventing direct connections

these are all things i've wanted to do in versions 5 & up but were unable to due to how the usid mechanic functions.

currently the list is in vars instead of one of the 3 server jsons (since it functions independently), i suppose this might be subject to change even thought i doubt the list would get updated more than a few times, and iirc mods can still access it as a hotfix.

note that this draft does **not** support grouping by numeric ip (empty stuff before the `/` is ignored)

some comments that didn't make the cut:
```
    /** Servers that start with these domains re-use the same (admin) usid. */
    /** Domains that cause clients to group the usid (admin) */
    /** Use domain level groups instead of ip + port keys for the usid when . */
    /** Assigns a single usid to a domain . */
    /** Domains in this list get their own usid group. */
    /** Each ip:port has their own usid, unless the server's domain is part of this list: */
    /** Servers using these domains share the same usid regardless of ip:port */
    /** Servers using these domains get their own usid regardless of ip:port */
```

> mainly done in preparation of the cool stuff shown in `#dev-previews`, getting this code in place in time :)

(disclaimer: adding servers to this list would cause all players to generate new usids for those servers, but that's intended)"

Following CleanupCrew's suggestion
There is an exponential slider (from 1 to 1M) to setup the power wanted but i'm kinda trash at UI so i'll let that here as a draft for now
Being able to type directly how much you need might be a better idea but i dont know how to do it
looks like this btw

(yes i dont know how to apply styles so here's a tex)

EDIT #1:

Remade the UI from message block. Ditched the slider for keyboard input. Now supporting negative power.

The solution is simple, resolving dependencies before loading anything, it features:
- more complex dependency trees
- detecting missing dependencies
- preventing circular dependencies

The code is tested and it works fine, It's just that the structure of `Mods` is a bit hard to follow, so I need your opinion on how the missing/circular dependencies should be handled and what to do with the `dependencies` and `missingDependencies` fields of `LoadedMod`.

Add hostname for discovery and connect
through the hostname can know the server the client tried to connect to.
May like [Minecraft](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Handshake)

## Usecase
- Can show different info for different host discovery
  - many in one with ping through
  - notify the player to change to new address
- Implement jump server
  - through the hostname, can redirect player to different back servers.
  - In this jump server, can check player uuid and usid, provide auth info to back servers

## Need Help
modify arc-net discoveryHost packet and discovery handler.
For compatibility, the extend field can be optional, check the length in packet to determine.

## More
- may add `version` field to discoveryHost packet
- may add `locale` field to discoveryHost packet

My version of unloaders :
Featuring load balancing, backflow definitely dead, no item skip with nulloaders depending on framerate or belt speed, speed exploit with multiple inputs fixed, and diverses smart mechanics

You guys should really like unloaders now they work flawlessly :)

Impact on designs and schematics :
Wont break any design, in fact they will all run much better and more smoothly.
Make placing gates and sorters next to unloaders to make them more reliable useless
The speed exploit with multiple inputs being fixed requires to change a handful of designs at most, those with plast input doing snakes.

- The gamemodes are now just icon buttons with a hover tooltip of the gamemode name. The table is labelled so there wont be confusion for which one is which.
- You can hide/show both custom maps and default maps, in case someone wanted that.

Also added an option to toggle including map description and author in the search filter, both of these can be independantly toggled.

This is mostly because #6075 introduced the extra searching options but the way they were added was a bit vague, so i figured i might as well just clean up the entire filter menu and add them in as well, plus extra functionality is nice. Demo:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62061444/137827398-a1022af7-14aa-48cd-8e9f-2bd15ecbffaf.mp4

Also added search for saved games. Details:
 - The search is identical to map search.
 - The filters are buttons on the bar, since there are only gamemode filters. Custom/inbuilt maps and extra searching parameters dont really exist.
 - Changed the ""No saves found!"" to just be text instead of a disabled button for consistency.

Demo:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62061444/138133746-36f4f5c0-11f6-4040-8817-326a640436ff.mp4


Also this is entirely unrelated to this pr, but about half of the default maps don't have an internal author name, but the preview shows `Anuke` as the author name. This does make specific search results a bit strange, since you expect to see the map, but you don't.

I had my suspicions on the mesh rendering of floors since it flushes the sprite batch, which isn't probably the issue, but whatever.
- `SaveWriteEvent`: As opposed to `SaveLoadEvent`, this event is fired when _writing_ the save file. Tested by doing:
  - Run these in the JS console fragment:
    - `Events.on(SaveLoadEvent, () => Log.info(Vars.state.rules.tags.get(""do"", ""would"")));`.
    - `Events.on(SaveWriteEvent, () => Vars.state.rules.tags.put(""do"", ""did ;)""));`.
  - Launch to a map. The JS console should print out `[I] would`.
  - Exit to the main menu, and go back to that map via loading its save slot. The JS console should print out `[I] did ;)`.

742952514,Cryo tiles,TranquillyUnpleasant,2021-09-26 21:38:11+00:00,2021-09-27 18:46:28+00:00,{},"Since all the other liquids have tile versions that can be used in maps, i figured cryofluid should also have said tile variant. It provides an interesting new liquid tile to work with that goes very nicely with cold themed maps. Notable properties and related potential reasoning:

The cryofluid pools could have been formed over a long time as titanium slowly dissolved into water, or could be remnants of the accidents from previous unknown civilizations.

The pools are shallow, and such cold temperatures reduces pump efficiency, making extraction slower.
(50% pump efficiency because everyone was crying about this being op)

The pools glow faintly with a slightly blue tint. 
(Is cryo radioactive? Why does it emit light as a liquid? Idk but if the liquid does then the tile should too i guess)

Since cryofluid is much less viscous than tar or slag, drowning units only have a 50% debuff to speed when going through it, as opposed to an 80% for the other two. They are of course affected with the freezing status effect.

Also made a shader for the fluid that sort of mimicks a 'freezing' effect, the effect is a bit subtle and the shader looks similar to tar and slag when zoomed out:

Figured i might as well add this since #2080 seems dormant. Since the entire search bar and filter button is a slim line it shouldn't cause too many issues with mobile landscape vertical space.

I did some experimenting to see if I could fix the bullet direction and location, but it didn't work right. The only way I can think of to fix this is to move the location and angle calculations to inside of the `shoot` method. Which'll break a lot of stuff.

probably the biggest Pull Request I've ever done, and ~~the most (somewhat) broken one too.~~ it's pretty good, no(?) hardcode and broken code.

It's all started from a little changes to fix and continue my previous pull request, but then it grew bigger and bigger into this.
Everything works fine, at least on my machine.

Improved Wave UI again, yes, it takes more than a month to finalize this, and the contents changed are too much to be called ""Improved"", what you'll see below is changes from the first commits + some updates, for full updated summary see comment below.
yes, I know, the percentage of Anuke merging this is (very) low, but this project has taught me many things, so it is worth it even if this got rejected.

# ***ADDED CONTENTS***
### **Wave Search**
a search field, allows you to search by waves (you can only type in digits)
limits to 8 digits because integer limit and why'd you want to see trillionth waves

when you enter a number more than 0 in the search field, the wave group on the left will show only the group that spawns in the specific wave you searched.
using math, the wave graph will also shift to the specific wave you searched, for further lookup. The associated math is extremely accurate, so the graph shifted to the exact wave you searched, very satisfying huh?

Math for graph shifting if you accidentally saw this pull and don't want to browse the messy files:
`Math.max((searchText - 1) - (displayed / 2) - (displayed % 2), 0)` displayed -> displayed amount of waves in graph

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132953895-f26ba2c8-10a0-45f4-b139-f924dff15ecd.mp4

---
### **Wave Filter**
**UPDATE:** pretty much fixed all the heresy and problem, with the cost of filter health mode being taken off to only two

~~`this part is the most broken one in my opinion, yeah, 100+ lines of code, for a dialog.`~~ somewhat broken, just not as worse as before.
basically filter wave group like wave search, but more specific
filter comes with **Health, Wave start-end, Unit Amount in x wave, Group Effect** and also **Strict Filter** check to make the filters super accurate, to much accuracy isn't good either though so I made it as an option check.
Health filter is basically useless so I added modes for them, with 2 modes: **"">""** and **""<""**, well, more than and less than.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/134113407-134012dc-a5c4-43ba-a6b7-30d028d25182.png)

you can access it from a filter icon button near wave search field.

---
### **Wave Group UI**
basically everything about the wave group that I can possibly fit, and it's still looks pretty.
moved wave duplicate and effect into one dialog, + with payloads and items (**UPDATE:** I also implemented working group items)
also with reset button, which resets the payloads, items and effect (but not wave begin, spacing, shields etc.)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132955118-7a3d7cfd-0c22-483e-a974-d700fc00e8e6.png)
(yes, upside-down pyramid shape, beautiful right?)


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132955846-de163079-588f-4bb3-a842-8a734acbb4b6.mp4

payloads, with a list of payloads on top, units that is bigger than the group type's payload capacity will be hidden, and the unit button will be disabled if that unit is bigger than group type's payload capacity minus the total payloads, and also with a big clear button for clear all.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132957212-72c264ae-75f7-4715-ac7f-46335ce7dfb7.png)
Oct, with 28 crawlers as its payloads

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132955892-a48c46e0-a50c-40bd-ad18-f48f83ebf411.png)
items too, with amount on top.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132956032-16f06125-368c-4514-980d-c016e63510a7.png)
**BONUS:** the payloads button will be disabled if the group type is not a payload unit (~~`currently using group.type.payloadCapacity <= 8 check because group.type instanceof Payloadc always returns false, for me.`~~ I use `constructor.get()` and it worked, finally.)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132956303-48fb58a6-c68e-4208-b098-0afa4c90897b.png)
everything will be under a settings icon button.

---
### **Others**
as I promised in the [prequel](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/pull/5853), I put the wave sort button next to the ""**add...**"" button.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132956517-b349cae4-ed52-40bb-bfa5-0f0134c4853a.png)
also updated the sort enum to use Floatf secondary sort, rather than entire comparator, and added tertiary sort with oddly-specific Floatf, in case secondary sort isn't enough.

and since the effect button is replaced by wave group, I decided to put the effect icon near the unit icon, like in the prequel.
Q: Why not payloads/items too?
A: because it'd cause bloat, and people rarely adds items anyways, and payloads is a Seq. You can still see the items by clicking the Wave Group button to see its icon.
###### for payloads? good question, well.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85090668/132956685-f8a8bb19-b9f0-499a-8cb1-d6efd85841db.png)

I also make the ""**edit..**"" button dialog wider, because why not.
plus, make the `expandedGroup` null if the group you're removing is expanded, it's like some sort of a hidden bug found while testing I guess?

---
TODO and complaints, and thoughts:
- [x] ~~`Godzilla had a stroke trying to read the code and freaking died.`~~ Optimized the code significantly, or at least it's not broken anymore.
- [x] ~~`find a better check for Payload units, since group.type instanceof Payloadc always return false, for me.`~~ I use `constructor.get()` and it worked, finally.
- [ ] the `updateIcons()` is kinda wack with multitables.
- [x] ~~`I made between method specially for the filter statement, and it looks ugly as hell, there should be some alternate ways for this.`~~ simplified the filters, eliminating useless methods in the process
- [x] maybe some sort of zoom speed for wave graph? it'll be pretty fun, but useless, so I'll probably hide it under `Vars.experimental`.

[complaints part, I guess?](https://zajc.eu.org/mine.png)
- [x] ~~`**OH MY GOD 6 LINES `IF` STATEMENT!** should probably make it some sort of method(?) and remove between since we don't have to worry about the amount of lines anymore.`~~ I simplified the filters.
- [x] I should make the payloads clear button separate from the pane, because if the pane pop a new line, it'll pop too for cancel button, which looks ugly.
- [x] ~~`currently the group items doesn't work, the UI is fine, but the spawn group doesn't read/write the ItemStack, either fix it or hide the UI under Vars.experimental (well, that doesn't fix anything).`~~ finally implemented the working version it.
- [x] ~~`I probably reusing showUpdate() and showEffect() in the ugliest way possible; slapping booleans.`~~ well, fixed one, another one is impossible to fix so I'll leave it there.
- [x] ~~`the filter dialog is very space-eating, with around 100+ lines of code for a pretty useless dialog, should probably add a seq to filter group by units, that might make it not useless in a way, but it's still heresy`~~ I simplified it with less filters, and use `numField` method to reuse text fields.

with all it's heresy code, I'll make this as a draft, if there's something you don't like/don't want a UI of it, or the PR's content is useless/too much/generally bad/outright bad/delete this immediately, suggest me.

729004781,Add a copy button to spawn groups,TranquillyUnpleasant,2021-09-07 22:54:20+00:00,2021-09-09 23:38:56+00:00,{},"It does exactly what you expect it to:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62061444/132419416-e52ffebe-8bb8-43c3-be1c-0cefacdf5ef5.png)

Other changes:
- Made sorting use comps and have a secondary sorting parameter to prevent this weird group jumping when copying groups with similar sorting parameters:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62061444/132419627-46db39e4-d32e-4dc3-95ec-85131ad04502.mp4

- `buildGroups()` is called instead of `updateWaves()` when removing a spawn group to prevent desyncs between the UI and the value of expanded group, otherwise you can run into situations where clicking a group doesn't expand it and you have to click again:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62061444/132419773-f52a6e01-1df7-418d-8511-f8b4e7ef9609.mp4

(This was already an issue but it didn't matter before since identical groups were basically non-existant before)


If this is too many items for the bar i still have the other layout for copying groups i can make a pr for.

also add `PlayerSwearEvent` for future stats counting and plugin? hmm.
Feedback are welcome :D
if you want to add more censors, just add more words in the regex.

TODO & thoughts:
- [ ] numbers and symbols will be removed from the message if the message has swear words, gonna fix that.
- [ ] what about language/server-specific swear censor words? how would that work though
- [ ] censoring symbol should be based on swearing word's length

Full changelog:
- `nextStep` obtains the next step in a `1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 10 -> 20...` sequence for cleaner graph intervals.
- `maxY` determines the maximum amount the Y value should reach.
- `maxY` also determines the amount of padding for the axis labels.
- The number of vertical sections in the graph are clamped to 10, which should be reasonable, as opposed to the relatively large amounts it reaches if the graph size is used.
- There is a mostly transparent horizontal line on each graph mark, for reference. It does not interfere with the graph itself much, but provides a nicer reference point compared to trying to guess where it is.
- Minor formatting fixes because spacing was strange for some reason.

(Might need a better name but copy might get confused with copy to clipboard).

this PR adds `allowBridging` which allows the placement to bridge over this block, true by default.

also made Distributor and Liquid Tank set the `allowBridging` to false, why? because people complained about it, see the first paragraph. Also why Liquid Tank? well _technically_, liquid tank is a big Liquid Router, same as Distributor.

Conduit will still bridge over the Distributor, even if `allowBridging` is set to false, well because Distributor cannot replace the conduits, basically not in the same category as the blocked (Distributor) block.

NOTE: idk why in the video, the guardian icon is missing, might be my computer being weird.

obviously, the code is not the best, to be honest, hence why I made this PR as a draft.
might post updates here later when some progresses is done

TODO and ideas:
- [x] make the code more compact and reduce the amount of space-eating if/else if possible, abuse ternary ? : operator.
- [x] add the ""**Overdrive**"" status effect back, as it fits right in for this PR.
- [ ] try to make the filter icon stay next to or near the ""**add...**"" button if possible, I tried but it's very buggy smh.
- [ ] If possible, try to fix/improve the other mechanics in the wave dialog.
 _
- [x] maybe use big filter icon for easier identification?
- [x] maybe option for filter to reverse sorting?

- New strings/changes up to commit caa34c959e9d23068ac922e589257eb56fc8be55
- Let's face it: `overclock` doesn't really have a translation and likely won't ever receive one. I partially tried to avoid the issue by using `overdrive` as a substitute, but it was bound to fail, as overdrive as a status would later be exposed. Now, `overclockat` [is a thing](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking), but I'd say our language created... whatever that is... out of necessity; it does really not sound right. Would you rather say `Mi-am făcut overclock la calculator.` or `Mi-am overclockat calculatorul.`? IDK and I don't care whether `overclockat` is widespread or not, but I'd rather keep it as it is: `overclock`. Completely untranslated,  still awkward, but much less awkward.
- `status` >>> `stare`. Yeah, `status` did indeed remain from latin and with the recent increase in people using it with the English meaning it doesn't always sound all that unnatural. However, as I've come to learn, in Romanian its meaning is much less broad. The dictionary effectively redirects you to `statut`. So `status social` works just as `statut social` works. But to say `my status: I'm wet` >>> `starea mea: sunt ud`. So yeah, it's not like in English.  Imagine saying `statusul meu: sunt ud`; this sounds as bad as saying `forch` instead of  `fork`.

- New strings/changes up to commit 1b0de739f935787daf41bb814d35979fbec650e8
- Team names are now capitalized (not the first to do that) and standardized to male singular. And I wouldn't change something if it wouldn't be pretty broken... In previous versions, the `blue team` (`{0} team`) would just be `echipa albastră` (`echipa {0}`). So `team.blue.name` is `albastră`, team adjective is female singular. Plain and simple, no headaches. However, given the changes in a5fe8970c6b36fca6f7e80ef551d82f4531d066d, `[#0000FF]blue[] core` (`[#{0}]{1}[] core`) could now become `nucleu albastră`, this combination of male noun and female adj which is plain infuriating if you care the slightest bit about perfection (and when you think this may not be the only language affected...). Yeah, `nuclee Albastru` (instead of `albastre`) doesn't sound ideal either, but I figured out it's the best that can be done using only bundle modifications. `echipa Steaua`, `echipa Albastru`, `nucleu Albastru`, `nuclee Albastru`... `echipa Abandonat`, echipa unde totul este abandonat, unde găsești un `nucleu Abandonat` sau două... Etc, etc. It's the best fit IMO.
- Since `Агрессоры` is our perfect ~slavic~ _latin?_ Anuke-approved word, and Crux is expected to get more lore in the far or near future, I decided to go for it. `team.crux.name = Agresor` (Special thanks to the Russian translators)

* Heat is higher than zero even when there's needed amount of cryofluid in reactor (only with high production efficiency).
* Reactor is cooling down when it's disabled even without cryofluid (very slowly...).
* Smaller need of cryofluid and slower cooling.
* Cooling, item rate and production efficiency is based on floor heat.
* Cold/water floor have negative heat attribute.

if they bump into the back of another one the speed boost resets, this avoids ""are we there yet?"" bumping extravaganza.

it just feels like this makes (more) sense since its not the tile that is moving the item, but rather the entity on it.

not the most perfect solution to streamline their visuals, but its at least a step up from how they behave now. 🤔

- `maps` displays custom maps only by default.
- Remove colors from map names so the name is actually readable for some maps.
The command has an additional `all` optional parameter to show default maps as well. 
The command description has been updated to reflect this.

- Color codes are removed from various places that show map names in terminal.
- Map finding function now strips both input and map name equally before comparing, making it compatible with all input/map name combinations. This change is reflected in both `host` and `nextmap` commands.

- The `help` command has an additional optional command parameter, to get help on a specific command.
The command description for help has also been updated to reflect this change.

The water to spore pod ratio rigged it's production since it takes more water to produce a spore pod. 

The only way to regain the buff back is to change the values to the original ones proposed in #5088,  but with an extra change; flammability. 

If we change the flammability to 90% (100% is already good, but feels similar to coal) it should affect the power production of steam generators and can (possibly) remove the existence of direct spore pod - steam generator powercubes. 

Speaking of powercubes, adding the extra commit to Items.java is considered unnecessary since it won't bring back land powercubes, but will possibly nerf the water limited powercubes. "

I tested the changed bundle as a mod by simply saving the edited bundle text on the test mod folder, but I believe it should also work when merged into the source code, and also because it's something that is pretty simple.

Not everything is translated yet, logic commands and its tips still have to be translated. I believe some other stuff also doesn't have a translation, since I didn't do a general revision of the game to see that, although I believe almost everything should be translated now.

(for Brazillians):
Eu mudei algumas coisas que estavam ou erradas, tinham erros de português ou simplesmente soavam estranhas e também adicionei um monte de coisa que ainda não estava traduzida.

o bundle modificado foi testado como um mod simplesmente salvando o arquivo de texto modificado na pasta do mod de teste, mas acredito que também vá funcionar certinho quando colocado no código fonte em si até porque é algo simples.

Não é tudo que foi traduzido ainda, lógica e suas dicas ainda tem que ser traduzidas. Acredito que outras coisas também, foi não fiz uma revisão geral no jogo em português para saber, mas acredito que a maioria deve de estar traduzido agora"

in v5 we used `Call.sendMessage(message, null, null);`
this has as a side effect that the chat message does not appear above the name of the player

in v6 we used `Call.sendMessage(message, null, player);`
this has as a side effect the entire message is duplicated above the player:

ideally there should be a way to introduce a mechanic to allow for a prefix/suffix/format without duplicate text.

in this prototype i have added a configurable prefix & suffix that currently gets sent with each chat call.
(server sided and not client sided, to allow for per player/message chat formatting, fairly important)

now this is far from perfect, i don't like the code i wrote for this _that_ much, and it feels like i am over complicating it.

for mods & plugins i have kept in some deprecated backwards compatibility, but that is currently not very ideal:
(not to mention the default is now duplicate, and while typing this i found `Config.<key>.defaultValue`)

To summarize:
V6 cultivators use:

- 28 water / spore pod 
- 126 power / spore pod

But BE21142 cultivators use: 

- 33.2 water/s (nerfed) 
- 132.8 power/s (nerfed) 

But with my proposed setup (shown in the code), 

- 24 water/spore pod (buffed) 
- 120 power/spore pod (buffed) 

Those are just **minor** effects, the **major** one was the space covered to make **3 spore pod/s** (watex included in the area calculation) 

- Original: 84 square meters
- Updated: 88 square meters (nerfed) 
- Proposed: 64 square meters (significantly buffed)

- Ability to create new menu on client from server, with feedback
- Allows to use `Call.infoMessage` with `title`

### Motivation
- Better UI for choosing, voting, answering online.
- I hate typing on mobile and I suspect some players don't even bother voting to kick griefer if they are from mobile because it takes typing out `/vote y` instead of 1 tap on screen.
- I have no idea if user *really* spent time reading my welcome screen or he is just standing afk

* Mouse middle → ""Pick Block"" binding
* Mouse right → ""Break Block"" binding
* Mouse scroll → ""Zoom"" binding

I did not want to rock the boat, but since game controls have evolved a little since editor keys were first mapped, I would prefer that editor keys were changed as follows, for consistency with game controls:

* Mouse middle (used for panning) → ""Pan"" binding (mouse forward)
* L-Shift (used for picking tiles) → ""Pick Block"" binding (mouse middle)
  * Behavior should be changed so key does not need to be held and combined with left-click to perform the action

The power consumption however is not completely proportional (should be 96/s) but if you compare it to the oil extractors, it still consumes a lot of power. So as a slight buff, 
from 96 units/s to 84 units/s.

Effects: 
It could change the oil industries and schematics, reducing its space consumption (from 7 to 4 cultivators) and power consumption. 
The blast compound will also get a fair buff, the blast mixer ratio to cultivators will lessen (from 2:1 to 1;1)

This server organizes rallies, riots, calls for malicious actions.

The Administration repeatedly violated its own rules, their administrators violated even more and were not punished, everyone suggested that the administrator put a lot of effort into it and we cannot simply remove him.

Also, this server has repeatedly arranged Ddos servers, they broke the servers on purpose and the administration encouraged others to do it.

After our return, we diligently set about destroying such servers.
MinDurka was also joined by the founder of MinDurka.ru who distributed hentai (NSWF) for a long time at http://mindurka.ru/

MinDurka copies everything from our server, discord design (Changed a couple of labels and think imperceptibly), the administrator himself indicates that he is too lazy to do something and is easier to copy than to come up with something of his own.

Conspiracy and ask people to download the O7 client (mod) and break the servers.

All docks in screenshots (Spoiler)

Their user violated the rules of Discord (https://discord.com/terms | https://discord.com/guidelines) and his account was blocked, deliberately asked us to return him and return all roles, which we refused because we will not tolerate users whom Discord itself is trying to protect from society, in this regard, he joined the ranks of those same attackers who break the servers. (This is Nexor for clarification)

Uv. developer, I ask you to help deal with this, since they do not care and they think too much of themselves.
P.S These are the same guys who convinced you to remove us, but in fact it turned out that they simply did not want competition.

To all this, I want to say that Mindustry.ru does not harm their servers even in such a difficult moment, we tolerate and will solve this in a more cultured way, involving the developer.

Неоднократно Администрация нарушала свои же правила, их администраторы нарушали еще больше и небыли наказаны, все сводили к тому что администратор вложил много сил и мы не можем его попросту убрать.

Так же этот сервер неоднократно устраивал Ddos серверов, ломали сервера намеренно и администрация призывала это делать других.

После нашего возвращения мы усердно взялись за истребление таких серверов.
Так же к MinDurka присоединился основатель MinDurka.ru который продолжительное время распростронял hentai(NSWF) по адресу http://mindurka.ru/

MinDurka копирует все с нашего сервера, оформление discord(Изменили пару надписей и думают незаметно), сам же администратор указывает на то что ему лень что-то делать и проще скопировать чем придумать что-то свое.

Устраивают заговоры и просят людей скачивать клиент(мод) O7 и ломать сервера.

Все док-ва в скриншотах(Спойлер)

Их пользователь нарушил правила Discord [(](https://discord.com/terms) | [)](https://discord.com/guidelines) и его аккаунт был заблокирован, намеренно просил нас его вернуть и вернуть все роли, на что мы отказали так как не потерпим пользователей которых сам Discord пытается оградить от общества, в связи с этим он примкнул к рядам тех самых злоумышленников которые ломают сервера.(Это Nexor для уточнения)

На все это хочу сказать, что Mindustry.ru ни как не вредит их серверам даже в такую трудную минуту, мы терпим и будем решать это более культурнее привлекая разработчика.

- seed? using the tile pos as a seed might make the patterns annoyingly noticeable
- ores? it was a bit to situational to hide them if the block/overlay wasn't air, and this looks fine

Also resized the buttons slightly to make the text less cramped looking, and so ""Randomize"" doesn't get cut on mobile.

- `despawned` no longer calls `hit`, fixing

![Screen Shot 2021-03-11 at 12 35 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/110781878-b7fcb880-8266-11eb-96b8-db0295ff6f2f.png)

i've tried some other method to keep it clickable, but in this draft pull i gave rally points the same effect (only to its own team) as enemy dropzones that push units away from it, here's an example of how it would look with the code from this pull:

![Screen Shot 2021-03-11 at 12 35 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/110782047-eda1a180-8266-11eb-99b4-2eff7f805ff3.png)

it still causes the units to shake a bit as they fight over dominance for a good spot, but now at least the rally point is generally unobstructed, also here's an example where the rally point has a fake size of 4, but that clearance would be a bit overkill:

![Screen Shot 2021-03-11 at 12 35 46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/110782181-1cb81300-8267-11eb-8e3f-d1cad26fc687.png)

and as for that other method, that was a disaster, i tried creating a ""skyscraper"" block property that makes air units collide with ""high"" blocks like surge towers & command centers, but oh dear the collision comp for that was a nightmare, units legs were a nightmare, power node layers, other layers, allaround one big mess, not to mention only the center of units colliding with blocks, needless to say that attempt didn't make it in:

![Screen Shot 2021-03-11 at 11 47 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/110782459-71f42480-8267-11eb-9f61-ec66f26817b9.png)

anyways, my goal is/was to make the command center easier to spot/click/use when there is a cluster of units blotting out the sky, the spawn zone knockback method seems pretty clean, but it could use some cleanup e.g. only knocking back units that are currently actively trying to rally at that point since it feels slightly weird if it interferes with all allied units 🤔

Changelog:

- New strings/changes up to commit 7145ffaf28049212e698ef2d350a0facce763f2b
- Status effect bundles, as expected. Multiple bundle improvements followed, which seems major, so I mention it.
- Changed ""Efecte Teren"" to ""Afinități"" for status.affinities (choice of terms is why one shouldn't translate alone)
- Changed ""forță explozivă ~[stat] {1}[lightgray] pătrate"" to ""forță pe raza ~[stat] {1}[lightgray] pătrate"" for bullet.splashdamage (it's finally accurate)
- Typo fixes & various other improvements

Notes:
- ""Păcurit"" (status.tarred.name) - This is not in our DEX dictionary. However, there's the verb ""a păcuri"", from whose participle I derived it, since ""păcură"" is the term I used everywhere. We also have ""smolit"", coming from ""a smoli"", coming from ""smoală""."

Why?

When you have a tiny map with limited resources, to help balance things, you would want to make items more effective.
You can make blocks cost less items with `BuildCostMultiplier`
But the only way you can make ammo's more effective is with `BlockDamageMultiplier`, and sometimes more damage per item isn't what's wanted, it is more shots per item. 

Notes:
  -  Does not allow values under 1 (due to problems with how ammo amount is stored with an `int`)
  -  Only works with item/liquid turrets; Does not decrease power usage of power turrets (Power is not an ammo, and it would be 
      a pain to implement)
  -  Does not affect coolant values (Coolant != Ammo)
  -  If ammo multiplier is too high, the item will just automatically fill up the turret's ammo bar (At 100, all turrets will be filled by 
      1 item)"

Currently, while batteries are being drained, power lasers remain white because battery power is fulfilling power needs. That means that when batteries are finally depleted, players are suddenly and rudely awakened to total power loss with no warning.

This PR colors power lasers according to the percent of total stored power being drained each tick. This solution should scale well to power grids both small and large, early game and late game. The color used is the same as [that used to indicate battery fullness](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/master/core/src/mindustry/world/blocks/power/Battery.java#L17).

The color change is designed to be sudden and immediately noticeable upon transitioning to a power deficit. From there, as the total stored power depletes, the color becomes increasingly redder until total power loss, at which point there is another sudden color change to indicate that. The color tinting caps at 20% stored power drained per tick.

These images show power laser color at 1%, 33%, 66%, and 99% battery depletion. Notice that the 1% laser color varies according to drain. Before this PR, all of the middle power lasers would be white like the left one.

as some were aware the v5 server ip landed you in ""silicon valley"", a small iq test map where you had to place a silicon smelter in order to get redirected to the actual server, this immensely reduced the amount of griefers and generally bad players.  

for v6 i have come up with ""disrepair"", here the task for the player is to simply place down either mender to proceed:

the 3 hints the player gets:
- map name is disrepair
- mode name is puzzle
- core is damaged

one of the first instincts of players should be to repair a damaged core. (besides, nothing else can be done on that map)
the moment they place down either a mender or mend projector they get sent to the actual server to join their peers.
when the last connected player leaves the map it gets reset to the below screenshot again, ensuring a clean slate.

lastly i'd like to mention that this pull which basically contains instructions on how to solve it doesn't break the concept, the goal for the player is to figure out how to make it through, doing it entirely by yourself / reading this / asking others / being told by others / etc are all valid ways, that is basically the gate, only players who can't figure out any of those get stuck.

storing the rotation of repair points seems to be welcomed, this pr hopefully does that correctly.

in terms of backwards compatibility it should probably be merged before 124 since it would break 123.2 (right?)

This first tap does not interact with blocks, so that you won't accidentally invoke anything else.

You can still move while mining. Mobile double-tap prioritizes units, so it is easy to control units on top of ore.

Improvements to single-tap mining:

* Mobile: Prevents mining by accident when you attempt to place a block on terrain with an obstruction.
* Mobile: Prevents mining by accident when you tap on ore while breaking blocks.
* Mobile: Tap anywhere to cancel mining. Mining was previously difficult to cancel, as you had to tap precisely on the tile you're mining, or move out of mining range.

Double-tap mining resolves the following issues:

* Prevents mining by accident when you intend to tap/click on something else.
* Prevents mining by accident when you intend to target/shoot an enemy. (Resolves [suggestion #355](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/355).)

Desktop right-click to cancel mining is unchanged.

@BlueWolf3682 @GreyMario

Additionally, on mobile, the second tap of a double-tap will not configure blocks if a unit was tapped, and double-tap detects units on the first tap. This resolves the following issues:

* Mobile: If a unit is on top of a bridge or power node, double-tapping the unit will not disconnect the bridge/node.
* Mobile: Makes it easier to take control of moving units.

## Implementation notes
The desktop implementation perhaps could be cleaner and replace `Time.millis()` with `count`, but may require adding method(s) to Arc equivalent to `tap()` used for mobile, with support for keybinds. Introducing easy-to-use double-click methods to desktop may be useful for other things in the future.

560325126,"Make schematics build insulated blocks first, power nodes last",joshuaptfan,2021-01-23 05:08:54+00:00,2021-01-23 15:28:26+00:00,{},"This PR sorts the build order of schematics when placed, so that small plastanium walls will be pushed to the beginning of the build queue, and all power nodes to the end.

This change fixes the following issues:
* Even though schematics in 6.0 remember power connections, that didn't matter at all as power nodes built halfway through the build order would often max themselves out with automatic connections before they could connect to their saved connections.
* For schematics surrounded by plastanium walls, power nodes outside the schematic could still make automatic connections to blocks inside the schematic during construction because some blocks would be built before the insulator walls were.
* Likewise, power nodes inside could make automatic connections out.
* Blocks outside a schematic would often steal power nodes' automatic connections so that by the time a schematic finished building, no connections would be left and some blocks in the schematic would be left unpowered.
* Schematics that used batteries to reduce the number of power connections needed would find some blocks left unpowered due to power nodes being constructed before some batteries, causing multiple automatic connections to be wasted on blocks that could have shared 1 connection via batteries.

Thus, schematics' power connections will look much neater after being built, and players will no longer have to waste time manually fixing bad automatic power connections.

As with anything involving build order, this PR does not address build order not being respected due to the player unit being out of build range. It also doesn't alter the build order of manually built designs.

Forgive these unrealistic, contrived examples.

(basically what you get when hovering over it with your cursor)

maybe i'm overreacting and this isn't needed and there's a really simple solution i'm not seeing, but being able to jump over an unit binder block if the controlled count is above a certain amount would seemingly make it way cleaner to scale stuff, as well as easily stock the controlled units if an unit gets ripped from its grasp in any way shape or form.

i'd like to invite ""pro logic users"" to give their reaction to this, whether it would be useful or not / etc, imo it is. 🤔

getting around on large maps is a chore, it would be nice if some sort of highways can be established for players.

this draft uses mass drivers for it, which will just send you to the next driver in the chain instead of allowing you to vent to any in range.

mass drivers just for player transport may be a bit overkill, so other methods like traversing power nodes somehow could/should also be considered. (to avoid unused mass drivers everywhere, and power poles are already abundant)

aside from figuring that out, this thing would probably also have to rotate or something to make it feel a bit more smooth, currently it just teleports you to the next whenever the previous soul particle has expired.

## Overview
Hello players. I made a pull in [Mindustry-Suggestions](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/1743) about merging bundle_fr and bundle_fr_be. Anuke told he was unable to do that because:
> I don't understand either language, so I would be unable to merge the two bundles with any degree of accuracy. This is best discussed and implemented by other speakers of the language(s).

So I decided to do that with the help of senri on discord and Voila. There is the updated version of the french bundle for Belgians, Frenchs, Quebecois and everyone else who speaks or learns french !
## Changes
There are the words and the changes that french players may argue about:
```

1. FPS -> IPS
2. Raccourci clavier -> Touches
3. Foreshadow -> Présage
4. Mace -> Titan
5. Scepter -> Destructeur
6. Reign -> Eradicateur
7. Lancier -> Perforateur (Its just an idea)
8. Chat -> Tchat
9. Minuterie -> Compte à rebours (Makes more sense for the waves i think)
10. Minimap -> Mini-carte
11. Supporté -> Pas pris en charge (For errors, makes more sense)
12. Hébergeur -> Hôte (the shorter the better)
13. Foreuse à vérin -> foreuse pneumatique (I don't think being super precise might help normal players)
14. Onde -> Vague
15. Percussion -> Percuteur (C'est un nom qui percute !)
16. Deleted the (e) until the file is reviewed by more people
17. Made the whole file more coherent, I mean there were upper/lower case letters where it shouldn't be.
18. Added translations for V6 content like logic blocks, sector description, turrets, units...
19. Some more stuff I may have forgotten

```
## Lines to verify in priority

## Conclusion
Like I said, I merged fr and fr_be, taking the best translations one by one and translating the missing lines (I even found v4 untranslated lines).

It also allows the block info dialog to be opened without actually selecting a block (by just hovering and pressing F1), thereby saving players 2 clicks.

this was the cleanest place to add the sound hooks in (due to shouldplay and pitch being private), instead of moving the entire function over here, and on first glance it might look as though scroll wheel rotate triggers this too, which it does not.

in short, this will make it feel better when you rotate lots of stuff like a bunch of conveyors in bulk."

this pull attempts to introduce a counterpart to rules, that allows for syncing a bunch of data that isn't meant to be saved.

currently the code looks hideous (looking at you `Iterator<Entry<String>>`), and i have yet to figure out the proper places to read/write it, since currently it just feels a tad wrong.

possibly it will be housed in `Administration.java` with some saving of some kind to persist between restarts? not sure how that'll work yet, and i might have to figure out what side effects it has on the clients.

obviously a lot needs to be done to make this work better (team checks / building still exists checks / etc), but in its current state the last accessed stays intact while syncing.

- get last accessed to persist when syncing, getting a filled in copy when joining & persist during server restarts

547863299,Adds Call#clearItems,Quezler,2021-01-03 11:05:48+00:00,2021-01-03 17:42:43+00:00,{},"https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/commit/6b3919e8f73bd1224356a954277f4a21d20e3b1d is great for when you need to modify one item, but not in bulk.

exhibit 1:

on nydus bleeding edge the launchpads can send items to the core, but the launchpad inherently allows for mixed items:
```
                items.each((item, amount) -> {
                    core.items.add(item, amount);
                    Call.setItem(this, item, 0);
                });
```
this results in multiple calls to get the intended result, which is a bit of a packet waste.

exhibit 2:

lets say for example you want to clear out a seperator for whatever reason, those items aren't sinced with the server so you can't do 1 call for each item present in it serverside, but you have to run it for each possible item.

a workaround for this could be the `send block snapshot` function (which i have modified on nydus v5 & v6 so it can run every tick if something is pushed to its queue), but that sends the entirety of the stream again while you just want to clear the items.

so:

this call will just be a performance shortcut, i can live without it just perfectly but it would be nice to have on board ⛵ "
547862302,Allow for core incineration via rules,Quezler,2021-01-03 10:55:55+00:00,2021-01-03 21:48:26+00:00,{},"i would like to be able to play with core incineration on the nydus bleeding edge server:

- once the core is full of something that production chain turns off, possibly causing power issues when some turn back on.
- makes mixed conveyors (e.g. lead with glass) less of a problem when the core eventually fills up with something.
- adds a nice challenge of having to balance production: not to little but also not too much
- possibly brings some more logic into play, like disabling a conveyor once the core is full
- no more need for impractical overflow + incinerator setups near the core
- makes it more in like with what is expected through playing the campaign
- maybe a few unforseen meta changes due to sideeffects, will be interesting
- currently a base level rule instead of team rule, maybe some map makers would like it overridable per team though?
- generally just interesting to experiment with, would be nice to have this for the time being on bleeding edge
- yes, i could have just written a plugin that constantly sets it back to like 100 below the cap and spawn particles, but spamming all those packets is just not very efficient while a relatively harmful rule addition is objectively better

(false by default of course, its an opt-in)

notable differences:
- works not just for mechpads
- minimap instead of arrows

todo:
- cache the results with an interval timer or just once each time you toggle open the minimap
- align the emojis better with the blocks since currently they are off
- maybe draw the actual texture over the exact pixels on the minimap?

currently leaving this in draft mode while i figure out what to do next, since minimap stuff & textures confuse me 🤔

**naming**
all other sandbox blocks are named either source or void, infinite is the odd one out

**power**
600k is just a weird number, this changes it to 10k per node, since its normal to need several item/liquid sources somewhere.
(calculation happens once in blocks.java since it results in `166.666666667` which would look ugly hardcoded in)

**modding**
any modded power sources (though i doubt (m)any of them exist) will default to what it was

**verdict**
i think this be a nice chance, the new power number might still be ""high"" compared to what e.g. the item source can output, but i don't wanna break existing saves that rely on a ton of power all to much, they probably didn't use all power anyways 🤔

- **adds the out region to the block loader/forge/unloader** (to avoid it being a symmetrical cube, though top ugly)
- **adds the in region to the block loader & unloader**, but also for all the reconstructors since they need unit input
- rotated the in sprites 180 degrees to make using them inside the icon array easier (counter rotated in draw code)

Not all players will play normally. griefers, kick command abuse...
This affects all users on that server.

But what if the user who first played the game gets into the steam server?
Most of them will be kicked out or ban as soon as they connect.
Even though players not doing anything.

So most users play the server on community servers..

I hope this resolves the server problem, but unfortunately, most community servers require authentication.
Because it's easy to cheating and too many griefers.

# so why need this?
This's a problem that has been around since the launch of Steam.

**backstory**
took place on the nydus discord, shows some initial thoughts going on, somewhat different to what this resulted into:

**technical**
- first time i tried adding logic, so i probably did it wrong
- intelij updated and broke a lot of stuff (red), so had to code blind, imports & castings might be sub-optimal
- enabled the commented out comment block to make the dialog look nice (and gave them both a new color)

**future**
no idea actually, its more of a concept at this point and it might be neat if the icons could be put on e.g. buttons to, or even persist in schematic previews or maybe even cycle through several, who knows, for now ima leave this as a discussion 🍿

scope: this pull adds a custom rule that enables servers (with custom plugins can use, not much use outside of that for stuff like the 3 block payload ones) to make certain blocks visible without having to mess with sector rules or other weird server sided shenanigans, this would be a lovely solution.

technical: the check is duplicated in both the hidden and visible function since that is how its currently already doing it for just the buildvisibility check, mimicked that behaviour.

usage: probably not that much outside of servers that don't run specialized plugins to give the inert blocks some purpose, i forsee mostly myself using it on the aforementioned server, but its a relatively small chance to the code that won't really cause problems elsewhere or become totally unmanageable since its basically just 3 lines and won't get in the way anywhere.

Note: You will notice that the Steam description is still English. I will not translate it. For cultural reasons. This is intentional.
Here, in Romania, few games are translated, and fewer have their Steam descriptions translated. Translated Steam descriptions are so rare that they are unusual for high quality games, hence a game with translated descriptions may be seen as unprofessional when one first opens the Steam page. I translated the achievements though, because having a Romanian translation but English achievements will, again, look odd.
Google play descriptions are another story. Google Play is mainly frequented by kids, and Romanian translations are not unusual. Translating that could bring some Romanian-only speakers to the game."

Now there is a problem with pasting and changing a selection. My idea is to bind paste to a key and deselect by simply clicking of the rectangle.

It is a QoL change that makes it easier to rapidly switch between sectors, without having to first click on a sector then move the mouse to the ""Go"" button. It changes very little code; the bulk of the changes was just moving the contents of a lambda function outside into its own function.

this pull does two things:

- returns you all the items if you complete the partially deconstructed reconstructor again (must be the same block)
- tags all deconstructing blocks with what they were so they can be restored if they have custom overwrote logic

during testing i found that you can place a larger reconstructor over a smaller one (and that does not transfer any compatible items), but i am leaving that outside the scope of this pull request (+ who even does that?)

pros:
- backwards compatible
- you now never need to use JavaAdapter unless working with interfaces
- supports any number of constructor args (think planets, bullets)
- also merges non-functions removing need for `a.b = c` over and over
cons:
- none

example:
```js
// Backwards compat alias
extendContent(Block, ""name"", {test(){print(""i am "" + this.name)}}).test();
// New variadic args stuff
extend(Block, ""egg"", {test(){print(""i am "" + this.name)}}).test();
extend(BasicBulletType, 10, 0.5, {test(){print(""my dmg "" + this.damage)}}).test();

however, `world.endMapLoad()` gives the desired effect as well.

currently (& in version `5`) the only way around this restriction is to send **the entire map** over again.

this call would simply allow for the (bulk) of changes already sent via setnets to visually update at once.

---

on the version 5 nydus server it got ""solved"" by tagging the player object with an array of tiles and forcing a sync if the player got close enough to one, aka: ""being in an area that significantly changed"", so the sync was entirely optional if you worked on another spot of the map, due to fully syncing taking a good solid second most of the time.

with this (on my desktop) it visually updates in the blink of an eye, and i doubt mobile users will have to much problems if this is used few and far in between (maybe several calls per minute, not per second to update small details)

i am not sure whether or not this has some side effects, but it just seems to do what i need: reloading world visuals :) 🌍 "

Summarization of changes: 
- Updated bundles to support weapon stat UI
- `AmmoListValue` now supports healing and sapping bullets
- Added a check in `AmmoListValue` from displaying `sapBulletType`s with pierce
- Added part in `generators` that generates weapon stat UI sprites

but now that the core can contain any item (including scrap) it would make sense that scrap walls return the expected amount.

even though you can't build them (yet) it just seems like a quality of life change.

- to keep the theme of wall costs i have kept the size 1 cost 6 like the other walls, but maybe less would make some more sense since there are chunks missing in the texture, though ironically that would make it even worth more scrap.

- sizes 3 and 4 are also multiplied from size 1 to make the calculation visibly easier to understand.

- technically just a suggestion, feel free to either merge of close this at your discretion: @Anuken ❤️

this prevents plated conduits from leaking at all due to the cap texture region forming a visible seal:

![Screen Shot 2020-10-09 at 10 07 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/95558976-57e3bb00-0a17-11eb-9697-8c5dba8af7d2.png)

this also removes the `leak resistance` property from conduits because its a technical nightmare that has bugged me forever:
- a resistance of exactly 100 would stop leaking, while it was actually a valid value.
- it was not really intuitive, `1.5f` would mean leak half, and `10f` close to but not exactly a tenth?
- https://github.com/topics/mindustry-mod?q=leakResistance no mod with this topic appears to use the property.
- https://github.com/topics/mindustry-mods?q=leakResistance no mod with this topic appears to use the property.

so this commit reverts that addition made in #999 and just puts the conduit leak rate back at what it was before.

personally i think this is the best solution for the problem, because even though it did leak less you would still not want to leave it unconnected for long or all the pressure would still drain rapidly over time the longer the pipe was, so now you can actually lay a purple pipe while it is already filling with fluids but without wasting any of it vs a blue pipe, i feel like this would be a good improvement to make the 3rd tier stand out more from the 2nd tier, and the votes on the suggestion seem to agree 😃

When I first started playing this game with my friends, I found that hosting was really frustrating because the @host.info button was within the HostDialog, but as soon as you clicked the host button, it would bring you out of the HostDialog back to PausedDialog, and you can't see the @host.info anymore. This made it so everytime I was trying to set hosting up, if I forgot the port number, or had to carefully read the host.info again, I had to stop hosting by quitting the current game, restarting, and then going back to HostDialog. Moving host.info out will help beginners set up hosting easier!

I changed Toxopid's name to Octopid. This would make more sense since ""Octo"" means 8 (Hence Octa-gon, but ""Octo"" actually) and Toxopid also has 8 legs. Other units may have 8 legs as well but I don't think there should be more than one unit with ""octo"" in their name (Btw there will be 3 units with ""oct"" in their name if this gets merged), also, I only could find a good name with ""octo"" in it for Toxopid (Random thought btw) and since It's a final tier unit and currently the strongest, Toxopid deserves this name most.

I looked at your commit ""risse -> risso"" and did similar things to Toxopid, i changed bundles.properties, icons.properties, Blocks.java and UnitTypes.java.

I didn't bother changing Toxopid in other languages because in the future they will be localised anyway, if it would be a problem currently I'd like someone to update them ASAP.

I may could have missed somethings, for example, in your ""risse -> risso"" commit there isnt a change in weapon name, but in mine there is and thats lucky because I remembered weapons also have name and I also expected one of them to have ""toxopid"" in their name, and there was, so I changed it. As said, I could've missed that, and I may already have missed somethings.

After all, I hope you appreciate this and I also hope this PR would be successfully merged. As said, not necessary but merging it shouldn't be hard and It'd be a good change."

This is because modded blocks are sometimes not meant to be rotated after placed, and a block cannot tell if it has been rotated unless it keeps track of its rotation, so in some cases it is better if the block is just not rotated at all after placed.
+ `rotateArrow`: whether the block placement is guided by the arrow icon.
This is because some modded block are using the `rotation` of the block in an ""unintended"" way, such as making only whether it was vertically or horizontally placed count(a.k.a only `rotation%2` matters), and in some cases it just makes sense to get rid of the arrow icon."

1. The schematic button is disabled or greyed out.

https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/96
https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/330

Stats: 

Health: 1350 (higher than ripple and cyclone but less than fuse)
Size: 3x3 (because Mindustry needs more 3x3 turrets; There a 4(1x1)s, 4(2x2)s, and soon to be 4(4x4)s, but only 3(3x3)s)
Build Cost: 200 lead (It uses energy to fire), 80 titanium (like ripple), 125 silicone (like ripple but graph is now silicone)
Power Use: 450 power/s (bigger than lancer, but smaller than meltdown)
Range: 31.25 blocks (smaller than ripple but bigger than every other turret in the game)
Inaccuracy: 0 degrees (kind of like a sniper)
Shots/s: 0.1 (slow shooting, like a sniper)
Targets Air: yes (its not an artillery turret)
Targets Ground: yes (its not just an anti-air turret)

Ammo: (shoots all hard/dense materials)
- Graphite: 300 damage
- Titanium: 400 damage
- Thorium: 500 damage
- Surge Alloy: 250 damage (because the shock effect doubles the damage and also damages things around it)

Boosters: (I decided to make liquids optional because this is a 3x3 turret, not a 4x4)
- Water: 1.4x fire rate
- Cryofluid: 1.9x fire rate

Finally, the pierce effect: 
 I tried hard to make this turret not too overpowered, but ended buffing it multiple times because it was outclassed by the ripple in almost every way (Dps, Range, etc.). 
Note that the pierce effect actually has a cap relative to the current lifetime of the bullet. Basically, every time a bullet hits an object, It loses a certain amount of lifetime. Also, this bullet does not add an entity to the ""collided"" list, and so may actually hit bigger entities multiple times, dealing extra damage. On the other hand, this was countered by giving the bullet a pierce cap (as I explained above). 
I made this turret to be like a upgraded lancer (with the pierce, and the fact that it needs power to shoot), but it is still unique due to its pierce cap, bullet projectile, and long range. 

Current Sprite:

I left the sprite in the raw-assets bin so this can be merged anytime. **Please give me feedback on the sprite in the comments**

For now, this will be a draft, as It probably isn't balanced yet and the sprite isn't very good. (Also, I'm unsure whether @Anuken will like the idea)"

456256699,Plastanium conveyors are worse than titaniums in every condition.,ghost,2020-07-24 12:21:58+00:00,2020-07-24 17:20:30+00:00,{},"Plastanium conveyor is only good when compared to titanium one with unlimited item source because it instantly fills plastanium conveyors but in reality its worse because nothing can instantly fill plastanium conveyors and in a condition which we use boosted airblast its a bit worse than titanium conveyor. I didn't test the other drills/production outputs but i guess it gets worse. Increasing the speed of it, the items get to where they should earlier and maybe makes it better than titanium conveyors because they almost have same speed but plastanium conveyors also have to fill up thats why currently if you have high throughput use plastanium, if you have low throughput use titanium because with low throughput it takes so long for 10 items to fill and go to somewhere but maybe increasing the speed makes it similar to titanium with low throughput. The distance between the two points are also very important because of the high speed it goes to somewhere so fast even if it takes so long to fill.

Current situation:
Plastanium: Has to fill (Bad) + low speed (Bad) (Requires very high throughput that is only done with unlimited item source to be better than titanium conveyors)
Titanium: Doesn't has to fill (Good) + low speed (Bad) (Speed is a bit worse than plastanium but that doesnt matter so much)

PR situation:
Plastanium: Has to fill (Bad) + high speed (Good) (Requires good throughput to be better than titanium and its actually easy to do it)
Titanium: Doesn't has to fill (Good) + low speed (Bad) (Compared to Plastanium)

If you implement this PR both conveyors will be good in certain situations (Plastanium at higher throughputs and Titanium at lower throughputs)

Notes:
• I increased plast conveyor speed by %25 but i didnt test it so it could be OP or maybe still similar to titanium.
• Maybe instead of increasing the speed you can lower the item capacity from 10 to 5 or something.

Buffed differentials to make them low maintenance (as no one really uses them). Also increased the energy output for all gens that use pyratite. 

Ammo: 
Made the status effect ""burning"" much more powerful. Also buffed all ""Incendiary""-type bullets.

The current realization exploits existing crutches with the rendering of colored shield frames in the Shader.

There is also another option, with rendering only in the block code and post-processing with the Shader, without changing the color of the command directly in the Shader.

Yeah. Mindustry is Sandbox defence game.

Admins have been busy and tired of catching griefers every day, not playing games.

# Not many multiplayer-only maps
There are more cases of building a meltdown or wave skip in just 15 waves.

A preview of what it looks like.

How it works using the default buttons, you hold down `Left Mouse Button`, and then hold down `Middle Mouse Button`, and then you drag across. If you want to force `Thorium Tier` blocks like ArmoredConveyor and ArmoredConduit to every block, you press `Left Control`.

As for mobile. When hammer is toggled, toggling it again will toggle the upgrade. You can select as shown in the desktop version, long press, then drag across. As for forced mode in desktop version, you can toggle the lock icon at the bottom left.

~~Currently doesn't work with multiblocks as shown in the end of the GIF.~~

An alternative implementation to https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/pull/1009 and https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/pull/1722

EDIT: Some questions from Discord if I ever do a mobile version. Since this is a draft, I can put it on the TODO list. Originally I wanted to implement for desktop version first, mobile version in another PR.

so i started working on idea's for a measurement block sprite, and how it should function (sorters are instant / needs to support liquids / maybe like a junction / etc), but then it just dawned on me i could just add it to the `item` & `liquid` `sources` & `voids`:

basically those `4` blocks now measure their throughput over a period of `10 seconds`.
(during the **initial 10 seconds** the bar will slowly fill up, indicating it is measuring/loading)

during my limited amount of testing it does appear to flicker a bit.
(like between `4.2` and `4.3` for normal conveyors, but that [somewhat makes sense](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/master/core/src/mindustry/world/blocks/distribution/Conveyor.java#L53))

i am not sure how large of a performance impact this would have, nor if the measurement frame is of the right size, it takes a while to load but it seams nice to measure over a longer period of time, but its entirely up for debate.

_basically, allowing any block, floor & overlay in a schematic:_

Currently we have `Loadouts.java`, which contains as you know the starting core layouts, but that only consists of normal blocks, and its hardcoded to place ores under drills.

I propose embedding support into schematics for floor & overlay layers as well.

The reason i'm diving into this now is since i'm planning to explore the 6.0 `tile.setFloor` calls, and it would be nice to have some predefined ""ruins"" or ""decorated ore patches"" that are placable on the map (by the server) in realtime.

And to do that i'll either have to modify the schematic format / come up with some sort of editor generation setting for predefined embeds / create like a secondary map to be loaded in that functions like a spritemap of some sort that i'll have to map out / etc, basically the schematic approach sounded most logical.

I don't really intend for players to be able to use it in single player or multiplayer, but while developing this it does have some promising usages for the ingame editor.

The reason i'm leaving this draft here is for discussion on what would be a nice approach, since i'd rather not bodge in my own hacky solution that lack official support, i'm willing to bet that more people find this idea interesting, and thus a more official implementation would be required.

This is mainly for the case where resources are moving directly through a container, in and immediately out.  Before this patch it would be hard to read the constantly rebuilding table or select resources to withdraw.

This patch causes one more allocation (one use of ""new"") per instance of BlockInventoryFragment.  As far as I can see you only get one of these objects when someone clicks a block and it persists until something else is selected, so I though the allocation was probably acceptable.

This is also troubling when you import a map again (or one that happens to have the same name), you simply don't know how the already present map is called.

For a solution i propose to show the name of the two conflicting maps to allow for easier finding:

- needs full power to transfer (like phase bridges)
- configures like mass drivers (with unlimited range)
- transfer isn't instant (buffered for a tick)
- sandbox only (for obvious reasons)

> (copied mass driver code instead of reuse to avoid lots of conflicts upstream in 6.0)

of course @Anuken mentioned he didn't like the idea of teleporters, but this would at least put the aforementioned community at ease a bit if the poll does end up in its removal, i believe the chance of this getting merged is fairly low (target branch is also questionable), so i will just leave it here for now 🙂 (close it if you so please*)

This draft allows people to resume the build by allowing it to be added to the build queue if the block being constructed matches the current type.

Some things that are up for debate:
- it only allows the original block to be constructed, no wall/conveyor/drill hotswap upgrading.
- it keeps the rotation the original block was in, could either be annoying or fairly useful.
- and of course the code, no idea if i thought of everything, haven't tested it a lot yet.

This is a passive change. The user will have to manually go re-assign the category keys from their default (will continue to act acts like block selection in master). 

If they reassign the keys they can then use a different key combo to select blocks.

For example: 

1. A user rebinds category 3 to the key 'B' (conveyors category assuming the full tech tree is unlocked).
2. When a user is in-game. They can select the 3rd block in that category by pressing the combo `B-3`.

using a non default port to allow rewiring which server it point to on my end:
<img width=""412"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-02-23 at 10 09 15"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/75109547-aa0cd300-5624-11ea-964b-36f05702a930.png"">

the reasoning behind this is to be able to switch the port away from the main server in the event that i'm testing a (minigame) plugin that needs a bunch of players, so i can leach of the nydus entry in the global server list.

i intend to keep a close eye on the stream of (new) players that join through this new listing, i already have a small fleet of admins (which i intend to grow more over time), as well as developing new(er) antigrief measures as reaction(s) to what happens on this server substrate.

furthermore i was curious about the ""legality"" of being allowed to turn off the port under certain circumstances (huge influx of griefers / filled to capacity / etc), since the `SERVERLIST.md` does not mention requiring a 24/7 uptime sla, so i am curious on your standpoint on it.

also, the player limit (as can be seen above) is currently 11, which is not ""entirely"" true: 
![Screen Shot 2020-02-23 at 10 16 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/75109662-ac236180-5625-11ea-84bc-7eed801f194e.png)
(there's a ""secret"" double cap in place, so players who aren't scared of the player cap being full can still get in if they want to, this change grandfathers the change that admins can always join)
of course i plan to adjust the player limit over time based on the influx of new players if this pull gets accepted.

that's about it, thanks for reading, let me know if you (or anyone) has questions :) 🥔 

> oh, and with `modified jar` i mean that i have some server sided enhancements in place to slightly modify the experience, while staying within the constraints what the server can pull off without players requiring custom clients and/or mods.

This variant starts unloading the most plentiful item only when the storage it is attached to is filled above the selected threshold of 0%, 25%, 50% or 75%. The threshold is applied on a per-item basis for vaults (won't unload any item that is below threshold) and total basis for launchers since launch is triggered on total. Behaves like the Max Unloader when set to 0% since it reuses the same max search function, albeit with the initial max value set to capacity*threshold for vaults so items with insufficient quantity get ignored.

Basically, this is an overflow gate for containers that lets you pick how empty (or full) you would like to keep the vault it is attached to.

In the Tar Field run I started to test the threshold unloader one last time before opening my push, my core spawned in the SW corner, so I had to setup this little relay/sorting station in the corridor leading to large open area in the south.

The copper, lead, titanium and silicon unloaders are feeding surge alloy smelters as usual, a pair of regular non-sorted unloaders trickle-feeds my core a healthy mix of whatever passes by, one threshold unloader set at 50% lets the vault fill up to at least 50% of any one item before kicking in so it does not interfere with any items I am low on (it is unloading a mix of plastanium, thorium and lead in this case, the three resources above 50% of 1000) and a backup threshold unloader kicks in at 75% to help ensure mass receivers never run out of room to dump their loads."

My modification makes the take() loop persistent so take() will do complete laps around the item list starting from wherever the previous call returned from, never repeating the same item twice in a row unless there is nothing else to return. A significant improvement IMO.

How is this an improvement? With the original behavior, if you converge a bunch of belts on a storage block or launcher, want to unload a few belts of specific resources (ex.: copper, lead, silicon and titanium for surge alloy) and pass everything else including overflows along using non-specific unloaders, you are out of luck when the resources you want are at the top of the list since most of those will get swept away by non-specific unloaders. With the rotating take(), non-specific unloaders are equal-opportunity across all available resources, which gives single-resource unloaders that many more chances to unload more of their resources before non-specific unloaders get to them. It also reduces the rate at which items further down the list that may hardly ever get touched by the existing implementation will race toward the storage block's cap. The even drain across all items will help prevent things like mass driver stalls due to receivers filling up with an excess resource that isn't getting cleared.

It would be even nicer if dedicated unloaders had priority over non-specific ones (non-specific unloaders don't touch resources with dedicated unloaders unless the dedicated unloaders are overflowing), though that would require a rework beyond my current ""getting the stupid IDE and tool chains to work"" level of familiarity with Java development.

To sum it up: trivial change, big impact for people who like mixing belts and sorting them out with unloaders."

splits the server list in 3 distinct categories:
- local servers
- remote servers
- global servers

global servers and local servers are no longer part of the same internal ""list"" so you can still press/see/find the refresh local games button if there is a global server in the list.

local servers have been put way up top, because if there is a local game available on your network its pretty likely that its your own testing server or a server you would probably want to join for a plethora of reasons, justifying them being above your own remote server list.

global servers go at the bottom, since you'd want your own server list first, so you don't have to scroll for the servers you actually care about.

About #1112: I kindly suggest closing that PR. It would require major effort to fix these mostly bad translations. It might be more efficient to spend that effort on writing the missing translations from scratch.

changes it so the impact reactor needs to be full of blast compound in order to begin starting up.
(once its startup animation has started it will continue spinning with any amount of blast*)

this should help greatly since impact reactors tend to omnomnom away if there's only 1 in them.
and it might also make it a bit easier to spot (potential) throughput issues, among other things.

instead of placing the miner drones in the far edges of the map to get free minerals until the end of time, changes them so you actually have to take the items out of them one way or another.

its been discussed a few times to have a dedicated drop off point, but it would probably make most sense to make them drop off at their spawnpoint or cointainers right next to it.

this probably won't go well for drones that require items to spawn since it will unload.

but this would allow for some more precise mining drone usage, since you can get the right amount of copper/lead from anywhere in the map, instead of finding a patch or unloading it from the core 10 miles away.

While testing out the plastanium conveyors on my test server the other day (well, actually today) the thought occurred to me that i could merge my other concepts in there as well (e.g. the tractor beam), but that would only be fun to play with if players could switch between teams.

This is currently only possible if the mode is set to editor, but it would make sense to allow this for sandbox mode (though not by default) as well.

But to prevent abuse its possible to allow only admins to switch teams (in this initial draft)

Not all quadrillion team colors are supported, just the basis 6.

I would like to propose a new feature. I think, it might come in handy to have a display showing the current production speed of multiple blocks. For example, one might use it for estimating the exact number of the upstream consuming blocks that need to be built.

* Press CTRL
* Drag the mouse to select the blocks of interest with the bounding box
* A window pops up in the bottom left corner, showing the cumulative production speed per resource.

(i have tried higher throughput conveyors before but i ran into the conveyor code wall, and by random luck the train thingy i made recently sparked the idea of moving items on conveyors via entities, bypassing said code entirely, though this is arguably quite heavy because of the increased entity count, while it lacks tons of features, its a nice draft to showcase & gather feedback)

**backstory**
Most players would find it rather annoying if an air unit breaks through the defences of a large base which in turn dissect all small power nodes, while the large power node has quite a lot more health (which i only found out halfway through this commit 😳), this powernode is aimed to securely deliver power over long distances without to much worry in regards to in defence, and as a slight bonus it somewhat acts insulated since it can only connect in straight lines, which may or may not prevent some accidental connections.

**caveats**
- currently uses duplicate code
- two power connections in the same direction are possible, resulting in loss of a potential side
- should probably use a node/block property instead of a specific block check
- not sure if the white/glass makes the texture to detailed or not
- uncertain as to how useful this block will be in practice
- probably more

This pull adds a security level to go along with the uuid. (inspired by teamspeak)

To increase your security level you need to sacrifice some computing power to compute the next level, which duration grows pretty much exponentially.
(1-4 are relatively fast but 5+ will take a while)

Main purpose is to obstruct those using uuid changers, since you will need to regenerate the security level for each, which can take a considerable amount of time depending on the security level of the server you want to join.

Of course mobile users will have a harder time generating their uuid than powerful desktop users, but there's nothing i can really change about that.

Also malicious users could leave security level generators running 24/7 or rent large computing power/etc, so it might just get in the way a bit of normal users. (though normal users would only have to generate their desired security level once, which can be done with the device left afk or over multiple attempts, the progress is saved)

The technical implementation is currently one big mess:
- uses outside packages
- hijacks the mod list since i could not get the serializer to add a new field
- probably horrible from a cryptographic standpoint, but i'm not a cryptographer
- not sure how backwards compatible propper packet implementations for it will be
- currently settable for steam/local servers
- etc

Previously this used `I18NBundle.getNotNull()`, which would kill the process when it finds a given key isn't present. It now uses `I18NBundle.getOrNull()` which will return null values if a key is missing.
Returned null values are handled by listing the keys in a new ArrayList<String> , I may have violated the contribution guidelines here but I am unsure. When the ""About"" tab is clicked for the first time, an in-game error message is displayed with all the keys that are missing. After dismissing this message, the game just continues as is.

These changes add the following new locale keys: `missinglocale`, `missinglocale.single`. These can be used for displaying missing locale keys elsewhere in the project, however they only serve a purpose in the about tab in this pull request. If these keys are not present, the used text will default to `Missing locale key(s):`.

This is a whole lot for such a minor thing, but this is one of my first contributions to the project and I didn't really know how the project works. I now know much more of this and am still eager to learn."

goals of this pull:

- you can only place a building once you have all the resources for it, instantly consumes
- building will take longer than usual, but you can't channel it to build (faster)
- stuff outside the powerfield barely functions, if at all
- buildings construct using a warp in animation

didn't manage to really implement it to my liking, its one big mess designed to give a laugh, currently it only changes the building animation & powerfield logic, the rest is wip for now.

effectively just a giant battery.
uses high amounts (100) surge to construct, as to make sure that only higher level players/teams construct them & to discourage spamming them. can hold 300k :eyes: power.

I was discussing an idea about making the battery take consumables in return for extra storage space, or make it require cooling, but in the end i felt just making it overly expensive would deter people from creating vast swathes of them.

Ironically, the main purpose of the surge conductor is to hopefully reduce the size of the ""battery fields"" that people create in order to keep their power stored (like below).

This change is backwards compatible for map files, since it automatically imports banned blocks. (though its not backwards compatible with older clients, they will need to upgrade to use it)

The name for it is subject to debate, i've tried a few but none sounded fitting enough:
- `limit` sounds to broad
- `max` of what?
- `quota` sounds like a goal to reach
- `manymore` lorem ipsum

Current caveats:
- players can 'cheat the system' by placing many blocks in their building state, since the flag only gets applied once the building is fully constructed, i'll look into fixing that if this pull gets enough traction.

Oh and the placement of where the allowance shows is up for debate as well, it might be a bit weird for it to show up as a building material for it, but its the least out of place looking location i could have come up with.

- `unkillable`: cannot take fatal damage (maybe for asthetics or something, unkillable scap walls)

(multiblock tiles can have several under them, but in the case of a single tile block i added a `immortal` one that inherits all 3)

original idea was just to make itemsources unconfigurable, but the next best thing griefers might do is remove it, and if they cannot do that they will just try to blow it up, so the bottom two are just out of necessity.

needless to say the code is messy and stuff happens where it should not happen, but its just enough to get this pull reasonably stable as a proof of concept.

caveats:
- if the unkillable is under a core, obviously that team cannot die
- during refractor lots of `set` got changed to `add`, to lazy to fix it for this prototype
- if an unconfigurable tile dies somehow, and something new gets build ontop of it, the new block is also unconfigurable
- probably more

Just something i was working on as a surprise in secret, idea was to send a pull that added a christmas theme that would only be active on the 25th of december, with blinking light decorations / snow / red noses for mechs / snowball projectiles / etc / you name it, but i never came around to do more than adding red and green dots to buildings, and then i had to reallocate my time to work stuff, so it kinda just sat there all alone in my local repo, leaving it here so others might keep it company. 🎁

(Oh and before something starts shouting that i should not do such heavy calculations in here on every tick for every block, i did plan to move it to the sprite generator not much unlike how cracks are made, i just didn't came around that part yet 😗)"
346813592,🎇 Observer mech,Quezler,2019-11-28 19:08:45+00:00,2019-12-23 03:16:55+00:00,{},"![Screen Shot 2019-11-28 at 19 43 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3179271/69827716-d88f3380-1218-11ea-9b90-64f97ec03a68.png)

This is just a rough proof of concept, not intended to be merged straight away, yadayadayada, etc.

It adds a mech that (theoretically) can only observe, it can't: (well, shouldn't be able to)

- shoot
- build
- destroy
- take
- mine
- configure
- targeted
- etc

(it can however see block contents, block configurations, etc) (and can still use mech pads!)

The uses i had in mind:
- a mech to scout enemy bases on attack maps, since it won't be targeted, so you can have a peaceful look around.
- events on custom (modded/plugined) servers, where dead players or guests can still observe the game after they died or something, or perhaps a state to put new players in so they can be shown around without being able to grief anything.

(well now that i typed that out it sounds boring and unusable, but i'll continue typing nontheless to see where it can lead)

In a nutshell this is a highly situational mech, but the circumstances under which its useful do not yet exist, but its existence will catalyst the creation of the uses a mech like this provides.

Texture is based on parts of all flying ships, though i picked surge as a color to showcase its special status as compared to: `orange (attack) / blue (ambush) / green (support)`

Reused my `core-seed` texture for its (hidden) pad.

And that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads! Now evidently my cycloptic colleague informs me that that cannot be done. Ah, would you remind me what I pay you people for, honestly? Throw me a bone here! What do we have?

Many players are occasionally requesting a early/mid game electric anti air turret (which admittedly would be mildly op)

This commit on the other hand adds an electric anti air tractor beam, which can be used to reel in enemy air units to your turrets instead of having to wall your base off completely. 

Having air units dragged in allows anti air turrets with less range to be more useful in late games, as well as not having to anti-air every nook and cranny of your base, but just a few _venus fly traps_ (tractor beam + turret(s) group) throughout your base.

The tractor beam uses a lot of power (when active) and in return adds velocity to the closest enemy air unit to drag them in, though its not high enough to be inescapable.

Effects stack.

Please observe the following example, with the laser set to friendly fire my glaive:

* Made capitalization consistently Title Case for labels in settings and editor
* Corrected capitalization of the word ""GitHub"" in all localizations
* Highlighted ""[WASD]"" in tutorial for consistency with other text involving inputs in tutorial
* Removed extra space in mobile tutorial
* Added 10 second step to save interval slider in game settings
  * This is currently the only settings slider without steps
* Moved ""Dash"" binding to under ""Follow Mouse"" in control settings to group movement controls together
* Put Power Infinite before Power Void in sandbox for consistency with Item Source/Item Void order
* Arranged inputs in logical tiered order in alloy smelter's info (copper, lead, titanium, silicon)
  * Seriously, I always have trouble remembering what to feed alloy smelters because info has them in such a random order (see [chunking (psychology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)))"

341485672,Miner drone dropoff,Quezler,2019-11-15 14:13:33+00:00,2020-01-08 16:27:22+00:00,{},"https://feathub.com/Anuken/Mindustry/+261

Just another technical proof of concept, allows you to specify where an individual miner drone drops off.

Works somewhat, although conveyors seem not to render dropped of items on/in them.

Highly griefable, can drop of in anything that has items atm.
No bulk setting (currently), you have to configure each one by hand.

(spare your eyes and don't look at the code)

a buildable core block:

- cannot interact with tiles (`conveyors/unloaders/vaults/etc`)
- enemies do not go after this block (aka: not beeline to this core)
- will not count towards alive cores (implementation in pull inadequate)

intended usage:

- allows players to drop off or take from the core manually without being near an actual core (or just see the total available building resources)
- mining drones will drop off here as well, keeping the airspace around the real core(s) free
- can be used as an early warning system if a defence is breached, since it flashes the hud when damaged (depends on https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/pull/1058)

- https://feathub.com/Anuken/Mindustry/+207
- https://feathub.com/Anuken/Mindustry/+30
- https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/pull/955

todo:

maybe refractor it away from `coreblock` so the enemy units / gameover logic / etc would not need an additional check, preventing player respawns, etc, though still keeping the properties mentioned above ^ (and probably turret target priority or something so increase the chance of it being hit)

trivia:

- originally planned to call it `core-fragment`, but since i used the bush as a base texture (round to signify that it should not connect to other blocks) `core-seed` sounded more appropriate  

some screenshots illustrating the above:

This pull is a draft for showing the status of the power graph visually on each node instead of their web of connections.

- idle/unconnected/texture/etc: `default/null`
- making more power than consuming: `green`
- using power from batteries: `orange`
- using more power than is being produced: `red`

Colors obviously need some work, way to bright, and the surge tower looks strange now.
(and needless to say `red` could be anywhere from no power available to almost all power available, it currently does not majestically fade between colors based on the exact satisfaction)

The above feathub link suggested leds, but instead of additional block(s) it would be more logical to visually modify the power nodes.

These changes should communicate the status of the power network more cleanly to the players:

- `green` all is fine
- `orange` check on power production
- `red` make more power available

Again, this is a technical proof of concept / draft / yadayada, its quality at this stage is nowhere near mergable, code quality is mediocre at best and the graphics look awful, this is just to get the ball rolling.

https://feathub.com/Anuken/Mindustry/+206

This is a just technical proof of concept, do not take this way to serious.

It carries over conveyor contents when the previous and next building block are both conveyors.

This is useful when lets say upgrading an incoming belt of titanium heading into your core without slowing your progress since you're killing the required titanium needed for upgrading while you're upgrading.

But it also has a flip side, often when you want to get rid of items on a conveyor (e.g. `sand/coal/scrap` mixed in) its common practice to just up/down grade the conveyor to get rid of those items, this pull would prevent that, hence the draft / technical proof of concept.

A different approach would be to send all the items (that are capable of entering the core) directly to the core when destroying a conveyor/block containing those items, similar to the ""dropping of"" of a player / mining drone inventory.

But since that might feel like teleportation somewhat it would maybe make sense to grab the items from the belt and put them into the inventory of the player, but that leaves edge cases for when multiple items are on the belt, since units can only carry one (afaik), and of course the carry limit comes into play.

I'd love to collect some thoughts on this topic 📥

Basically what this does is making idle builder drones go around and upgrading upgradable blocks to their next tier. (in steps)

`conduit > pulse conduit`
`conveyor > titanium > armored` (only upgrades to armored if it won't interfere with sides)
`copper wall > titanium > thorium > surge` (plastanium and phase intentionally kept out)

This (currently) only upgrades if the before & after blocks are of the same size, it does not go around upgrading 2x2 single walls to large ones nor 3x3 solar panels to 1 big one, ima let that up to the discussion of this pr.

- power productivity, consumers can now (unlike before) increase/decrease their power realtime.
- drone pad standby, consumes no power while not in use.

Since drones are autonomous once launched it would not make sense to lower their move/mine/attack speed based on the condition their pad is in, and the pad is literally & visually not doing anything while the drones are maxed, so it would make sense for them to use no power during.

Possible balance changes:

- increase base power usage of all drone pads, to compensate the long run.
- make standby drone pads use a fraction of the power while on standby.

This pull is mainly to prevent the constant (dis)connecting of (mainly miner) drones to save a few grains of power, which seems like a chore to have to babysit them until they grow up. (or die)

**proposed**
This draft overrides drag-placing powernodes (since who needs those back to back anyways?) by not placing those middlemen.
By default it places them in a straight line, but they will use the convejor pathfinding when said key is held down.
It will not take existing powernodes on the map into account, thus the lines may interconnect in a strange way, though the beginning and end are guaranteed still connect one way or another.

When I had the idea for this suggestion, I didn't know that Mindustry already had hotkeys at the time (that were [removed soon after](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/commit/2e0e3512283afa923a2b5fb4a09a3b4977f5f5f0)). The success or failure of this new hotkey system depends on making it discoverable to players via hints/tutorial.

## Added
* 16 new key bindings (10 numbers, 2 category prev/next, 4 directions)
* Dynamically generated hotkey combo hint (e.g. ""Conveyor Key: [3,1]"") in each recipe's hover info
* Hotkey tutorial in tutorial mission
* 2 new desktop-only settings (block selection timeout, show block select keys)
* PlacementFragment.java method:
  * `Block getSelectedBlock(Category)`
* Category.java public methods:
  * `Category prev()`
  * `Category next()`

## Modified
* Blocks.java: Moved sandbox blocks to end of each category so hotkey muscle memory will carry over to sandbox
* PlacementFragment.java method:
  * `Array<Block> getByCategory(Category)`

## Cleaned Up
* Moved ""Dash"" binding to under ""Move X/Y"" in settings
* Capitalized ""X""/""Y"" in ""Move X/Y"" for consistency with ""Flip Schematic X/Y""
* Made ""# seconds"" lowercase for ""save interval""
* Added 10 second step to ""save interval"" slider"

**functionality**
This pull adds an insulated diode block, that (currently) forwards power (50% of the difference) from one battery to another if the power within `from` is greater than the `to` battery, a large battery can fully fill both small and large batteries, but small batteries will only fill large batteries to `4k`.

**example 1**
Below is an example of an `impact reactor` that will not shut down if the ""outside network""'s power turns negative, since the battery inside the walls will only store/transmit ""excess"" energy, thus it will always have just enough power to stay running, but it will export all that it won't need.

**example 2**
Below is an example of high energy usage machines/parts of your base that you would only want to run if there is enough spare power for it.

**thoughts**
- i went with the `plastanium` border color to signify its insulated property, which fits nice with the existing power insulation walls, to signify & prevent accidental connections through a possibly one wide gap.
- base texture was a solar panel, which is overlayn by what most would consider a diode icon.
- recipe is a mix between solar panels and plastanium walls, since its both electric but also insulates.
- not sure if i used `entity.sleep()` correctly here, it would make some sense to not constantly check for batteries until a proximity update has been found.
- my intention is to add a functionality to ""inject"" into the other power graph somehow, thoughts on that are pending.
- it extends `Block` since that was the first place i found that had rotation support, though it should probably be moved to a power block type.
- went with interacting between batteries since i wasn't sure if/how a block could support being part of two graphs, and battery blocks happen to store power, so this simple thing just facilitates moving power from one battery to another, not caring which graph any is connected to.

When transporting liquids over long distances the `pressure/fullness/quantity/etc` tends to suffer, this is my attempt to add a conduit that can output at a slightly higher  `〃` than its input side.

While it technically may not change a lot (a high to low flow won't ruin or blow up stuff) it would be visually pleasing to be able to get a large quantity of liquids to a location and pressurize it somehow (that does not involve filling the entire path to 100% capacity) to get that sweet sweet fluid glow going.

I had originally considered that it would need power (trivia at bottom), i instead went for a high tech material, surge alloy in this case, to be the explanation for why it works without power, open to suggestions regarding this. 

The below example setup is a bit crude, but it illustrates how that over longer distances chained `pressure conduits` the ""bonus"" adds up, and it can ""suck"" lower `〃` conduits dry, one could view it as a `reverse overflow gate`, since it can pressurize specific parts of a pipe network first.

(though they don't need to be chained `back to back`, as long as they are somewhere in a flow path their bonuses add up, the pressure they output can be seen as a ""checkpoint"")

Silicon setups don't scale very well once you need one or more blue belts of titanium 😗 
(and a plethora of other reasons)

This (obviously a draft) pull request adds a `multi-press` equivalent for the silicon smelter 😇 

But instead of requiring water it uses heat from its environment:

- source 1: magma tiles, up to roughly 2/3rd efficiency
- source 2: overheating thorium reactor, up to 3/3 efficiency

(the 2 sources are summed together for the final heat, but the reactor won't heat if its heat is less than or equal to what the magma tiles already provide)

Reasoning behind is that it would be to easy otherwise, these requirements demand some more planing/thought/placement 🔬 

- source 1: magma tiles are often sparse, and a 3x3 square of the _good_ ones tend to be rare, do note that the machine also works on less than perfect tiles, as long as at least something gives heat.
- source 2: having to create a controlled environment that slowly feeds thorium (or limits coolant) to get the reactor to overheat anywhere from 0 to 100% 

So the challenge this block provides is that you'd need to setup an overheating setup, the closer to annihilation the faster the machine becomes, so high risk high reward **or** if you're lucky the map will provide some heat 🏅 

Or of course use the normal ones as a fallback, but lose space in comparison, this would be neat in tight maps 🐁 

Oh and the `i/o` is the same as the smaller one, the batches are just larger, since this is just intended to safe space, but the subject is open for balancing ⚖️ 

Demo of several setups, note that i had disabled thorium reactor explosions locally, 100% efficiency is not exactly safe, but even the lesser speeds (and even more so with phase'd overdrivers) should be sufficient 🤔

330009548,🚧 Add insulator wall,Quezler,2019-10-19 11:09:52+00:00,2019-10-27 21:41:01+00:00,{},"**problem**

(especially when) playing on servers you might want to keep certain power grids(/graphs) separate from one another for a multitude of reasons:

- a mass driver chain with its own power supply
- ditto for phase conveyors
- keeping the production & defense grids separate
- have self sufficient thorium & titanium mines for a power plant that powers the rest
- preventing vital systems going down by accidentally connecting them to other grids
- etc

on single player its still ""somewhat easy"" to oversee, but on multiplayer not everyone shares your grey matter so they wouldn't be fully aware of grid intentions unless e.g. message boards are placed everywhere.

**brainstorms**

on my road to a solution i stumbled upon several ideas:

- a ""sorter"" block that could be connected to a grid that colorized their wires for a visual difference, but then what if one or more graphs get forcibly merged via e.g. a solar panel placed between them? would the colors somehow merge? how would the gui look to set colors? etc? 

- a setting on the powerpoles somehow that prevented all automatic connections, but that shares the same issues as the above, moreover: how would players on a server find out where the power sorting blocks and/or configurable powerpoles are located? would be confusing if for some visually unknown reason a wire would not (want to) connect.

- a wall block that blocks ""all"" wires from going over, but then it would be weird to have awkwardly shaped gaps in the wall just for wires to pass through, and you'd also have to have logic in place that would check for all wires above a wall once placed, overall a technical nightmare.

- so eventually i've settled for a wall that simply blocks automatic connections from going over them, players can still connect them manually, this allows for a subsystem to be completely walled without gaps, and power is also easy to extract, and as a bonus it communicates to other players that the separate grid is intentional, instead of others mistaking it for a bug and ""fixing"" it by proudly connecting it to the grid and calling it a day.

**considerations**

- a 1x1 insulator block would be more than enough, the 2x2 insulator would probably not be used (a lot), but walls come in even numbers so i've added it for that reason.
- texture is the titanium wall saturated down to greyscale. (hence why its declaration in the files is right below titanium)
- i've tried to mimic the recent commits where new blocks got added, not sure if this is the exact method you would have used, but thats why its called a prototype :)
- as of writing this i noticed that it only applies to placed power poles, placing other things would still cause the powerpoles from ""inside"" the wall the connect over them to said machinery, will probably send a commit to solve that soon.
- for the costs i went with silicon and glass, since those are common things to use in (high voltage) insulators, this commit also includes a tech tree entry where i've placed them behind the kiln, since it felt more fitting there than in the wall section, but feel free to change that.

This feature was mentioned in the suggestions/ideas, and this is often desired to be able to get specific item from the conveyor.

It can be configured by selecting one of two buttons below the items table when the Sorter is clicked and whether it set up to inverse match it's also reflected as reddish (signalling that it blocks/prevent highlighted item to move forward) bar near the top.

I'm not sure if that interface is the best possible and I'm not very attached to the icons I've made :). The size of the icons is the same as in the Command Center. Anyway, It's just a draft.

Tell me what you think guys.

297317327,Resources war - new pvp gamemode,Natchuz,2019-07-13 13:59:37+00:00,2019-09-16 00:50:17+00:00,{},"# Resources war
The general idea of this gamemode is to feed a special block with items, and gain points. Some items are more valuable and collect more points. When the condition is met, a team with the fewest points gets eliminated.

## 2 Submodes
- Regular - The weakest team gets eliminated after a specified time
- Rushgame - The weakest team gets eliminated after someone reaches specified points threshold

## Mechanics
- Remember to protect your Item Eater at all cost. When destroyed, points are also gone.
- Core is immutable, but when an enemy team damages it, they steal points from Eaters.
- Buffs. They appear from time to time and makes specified item 2 times more valuable.
- Lifes. Team may have many chances before final elimination.

## Todo & to discuss
- [x] Item Eater. Any idea of a better name?
- [x] Item Eater. You know, my graphics skills end on drawing stickmen. And texture... Could someone help?
- [x] ~~Tag submode. I thought of this, but I'm not sure if this should be a thing. Like in regular mode, but time resets after the weakest team is changed.~~
- [x] ~~Resources war. Maybe this should be Economic Wars, or sth?~~
- [x] Balancing
- [x] This may collide with my other PR, especially eliminated dialog (I made this before)
- [x] Some strings, and descriptions
- [x] I implemented limited respawns for this mode. We can disable it only for regular pvp mode
- [ ] UI. It's too complex. And this is problem"

I have checked the cyclomatic complexity of `MapRenderer.java` file through the analysis program which is a plugin of IntelliJ. The result shows the below table.

method | ev(G)<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> | iv(G)<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> | v(G)<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>
-- | -- | -- | --
draw(float,float,float,float) | **4**| 4 | 5
dispose() | 2 | 4 | 5
resize(int,int) | 1 | 4 | 6
MapRenderer.updateAll() | 1 | 3 | 3
MapRenderer.MapRenderer(MapEditor) | 1 | 1 | 1

updatePoint(int,int) | 1 | 1 | 1
-- | -- | -- | --

*Average* | 1.571428571 | 4.142857143 | 4.857142857

Summarize is looks like the below graph.

As you can see only one `render` method has **almost 40%** of cyclomatic complexity in this file. Therefore, I refactor this method and reduce the cyclomatic complexity.

# Changed list

Unfortunately, I can't fully understand your code. So, I think that you can think the some of the names are really odd. I ask for your understanding regarding this matter. Following contents are related in essential changes of my pull requests.

**1. I packed some formula**
    - Your code is really compact and reasonable. But some of the formulae was hard to read. So I pack that formula. An example is like below.

```java
// BEFORE
float offsetX = -(wall.size / 3) * tilesize, offsetY = -(wall.size / 3) * tilesize;

// AFTER
float offsetSize = -Mathf.floor((float)(wall.size / 3.0)) * tilesize;
FloatPoint offset = new FloatPoint(offsetSize, offsetSize);
```

**2. Add some `Point` and `Rectangle` class**
   - `Point` class separated built-in and nested class `FloatPoint`. Because of the former doesn't handle the float value. So, I added the handle the float value class like the latter. Furthermore, I don't want to interfere with your overall system. As a result, I made the latter with nested class.
   - `Rectangle` class is related in the region. I checked that `mesh.draw` has `x, y, width, height`. So, I added the appropriate class to make more efficient to map `mesh.draw` parameters.

**3. Separate two-part**
   - I separate the inner 'render' method to two-part(`renderMeshRegion`, `renderTileRegion`). I thought that these changes are necessary. But I don't feel that this naming is true. **With all due respect, please confirm this naming.**

# Result

After I did this, the metric changes like below.

method | ev(G)<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> | iv(G)<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> | v(G)<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>
-- | -- | -- | --

### Description
Makes config every frame using `Element.update(Runnable)`,
which means when a config of a block is opened,
if somebody else changes the settings of the block,
the change is reflected instantly instead of reopening the config.
### Changes
Buttons are updated every frame.
~~`configurable` is replaced with `isConfigurable(Tile)`.~~
~~`buildTable(Tile, Table)` returns a `boolean` value.~~

An enable/disable option is added to every block except
> Blocks that are either distributors (Conveyor, Conduct, Power Node, etc.) or not meant to be disabled (Core, Command Center, etc.) do not provide an option to be disabled.

**Functions**
- It can be used to not let a system run before it is finished, which prevents item-clogging and then rebuilding the clogged parts.
- It can be used to save _items_, _liquid_ and _power_ when needed.
- _etc._

**Changes**

- When `configurable` is `true`, it will add enable/disable option.
To disable this behavior, override `Block.buildTable(Tile, Table)`.

- `Block.enable(Tile)` and `Block.disable(Tile)` are added.
`Block.enable(Tile)` is called when the block is being enabled (not on placing it).
`Block.disable(Tile)` is called when the block is being disabled.

- `TileEntity.enabled` is the `boolean` which shows whether it is enabled or disabled.

- This will break existing saves as of whether blocks are enabled is saved to saves now."

This however breaks the tutorial sector which has all its tutorials based on a core at (60, 60). 
This pull request is a proposal on how the tutorial sector could override the core location through lambda functions while maintaining the current behavior of default Wave and Battle missions.
The MissionWithStartingCore class was introduced in order to avoid modifying the constructors in other Mission subclasses which are not interested in Core positioning.
An alternative implementation would be to create a regular virtual function and create a special subclass for the Tutorial sector which overrides this function and provides a different tile.
A third, but more cumbersome implementation could leave the tutorial sector core in the center of the map, but shift all other missions to the new location."

This happens in some devices as commented in libgdx/libgdx#4626.

Basically if the game is in foreground and you lock the screen the application gets killed by libgdx `AndroidGraphics` when resuming.
```
AndroidGraphics: waiting for pause synchronization took too long; assuming deadlock and killing
```
Luckily @codegist discussed a workaround in libgdx/libgdx#3861. This pull request adds the workaround to Mindustry.

Other than that, it would work just fine in ""alphabetical"" order, ABCDEFabcdef.  
However, in Mindustry font, caps and lower looks the same. So it looks really weird: ABCDEFABCDEF.  
  
This change makes it so it doesn't matter the caps/un-caps, it will sort the above files as AABBCCDDEEFF.  
(The slight problem comes when someone has two files with the same name but different caps at the start, but that seems like a less common problem, I feel.)  
  
That's the change that has been made here.  
I feel like it's fairly inefficient, so I hope you find a better source in the future.  
It also replaces a foreach loop with a fori loop, but there (might) be a better way to do it in the future."
